  "Lodi Garden Monuments": {
    "INTRODUCTION": "Lodi Garden, located on Lodi Road between Safdurjung’s Tomb and Khan Market in south Delhi, covers an area of 90 acres and is dotted with beautiful monuments and tombs, belonging to the Sayyid, Lodi and Mughal dynasties.With its undulating walking paths and jogging tracks fringed with ancient trees, colorful shrubs and flowering plants, the garden’s historical past is evidence of how the city’s present encompasses within itself a rich past.\nTill 1931, these tombs, mosques and other structures stood in what was then called the village of Khairpur, on the outskirts of New Delhi. In 1936, the villagers were moved from Khairpur and a garden was laid out with native and exotic trees and plants around the monuments. It was then called Lady  Willingdon Park, after the wife of the then British Viceroy. Post-Independence, it was more appropriately renamed Lodi Garden and was redesigned in 1968, by J.A. Stein, an eminent architect, who was also involved with many other buildings around the Lodi Garden complex. Some of the buildings are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and others by the State Department of Archaeology, Delhi.",
    "Tomb of Muhammed Shah Sayyid": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "Muhammed Shah belonged to the relatively short lived Sayyid dynasty which lasted from 1414-1451. One of the few architectural remains of this period is the tomb of the third Sayyid ruler, who ruled from 1435-1445.  It has some distinctive features of its time – an octagonal plan, corner buttresses, decorative plaster finish, corbelled doorways and chhatris on the roof.  The graves inside are those of Muhammed Shah and probably other members of his family."

    "Bada Gumbad Complex": {
      "LOCATION": "The Bada Gumbad Complex is located in the central portion of the Lodi Garden and includes the Bada Gumbad, a Mosque and an arched pavilion known as the Mehman Khana. The area was developed as the 'Lady Willingdon Park' in 1931, as part of the city of New Delhi."
    },
    "Bada Gumbad": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "This imposing building which is believed to be a gateway because of the absence of any grave, dates from the time of the Lodi dynasty (1451-1526 AD).The monument was constructed during the reign of Sikander Lodi, the son of Bahlol Lodi, who ruled for twenty-eight years from AD 1489-1517. His empire extended from Punjab to Bihar and he built his capital at Agra.",
      "LAYOUT": "'Bada Gumbad' literally means the building with a big (bada) dome (gumbad). Its entrance is accentuated by a flight of steps rising up to a height of approximately 4 m from the ground. Towering up to approximately 27 m and measuring 19 m x 19 m, this structure is one of the biggest and the finest examples of the Lodi-period monuments in Delhi.\nThe structure shares its plinth with a Mosque and a Mehman Khana (guest house), often also referred to as the arched pavilion.\nAll four sides of the structure are open and it differs in this respect from other monuments at the Lodi Garden in that the mihrab (the arch on the western wall which indicates the direction of prayer) is absent.",
      "ELEVATIONAL DETAILS & ORNAMENTATION": "Black marble has been used on the spandrels of the arches. The iwans contain the arched entrances with brackets on architraves. The brackets in red sandstone provide contrast and ornamentation on the massive structure.\nThe second image shows a decorative kangura or merlon pattern on the roof edge."
    },
    "Mosque": {
      "CONSTRUCTION DETAILS": "This mosque, built at the same time as the adjoining Bada Gumbad, is a fine example of the decorative technique of incised and painted limestone plaster used in the Lodi period.  Other distinctive elements are the jharokhas and corner turrets reminiscent of the Qutub Minar. An inscription over the southern mihrab (the arch on the western wall which indicates the direction of prayer) dates it to 1494.  In the courtyard in front of the mosque is a mound of rubble which was probably a grave platform.\nThe five-bay mosque measures 25m by 64m. The three central bays are roofed with squat domes while the two end bays have vaulted roofs.",
      "ELEVATIONAL DETAILS & ORNAMENTATION": "Facing the mosque is an arched pavilion that was used as a guest house or 'Mehman Khana'. The building has arched compartments and is similar in scale to the mosque, minus the domes and the ornamentation. The front facade has three large arched openings between the two smaller ones on the extreme left and right. Red sandstone has been used in the spandrels of the arches."
    },
    "Sheesh Gumbad": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "The Sheesh Gumbad (or 'glass dome', called so because the dome and parts of the facade were once covered with coloured glazed tiles), faces the Bada Gumbad. Home to several unidentified graves, it has been claimed to be the tomb of the first Lodi emperor Bahlol, who died in 1489.",
      "LAYOUT": "The Sheesh Gumbad has a square layout like the other Lodi tombs. It measures 17m on all sides, with a hidden staircase along its western wall that leads to the terrace above. Its western wall contains a mihrab, and the other three sides have three openings each - a central doorway flanked by two arched openings to admit light and air.\nThe central tomb chamber measures 10m on all sides and has several graves.",
      "ELEVATIONAL DETAILS & ORNAMENTATION": "Architecturally, the Sheesh Gumbad follows the pattern of the other Lodi tombs with a 'double storeyed' appearance, but differs from them in its ornamentation. Topped by octagonal minarets in the corners, the exterior divides itself into two storeys with the help of a projecting horizontal cornice. One can see the remnants of the former elegance of the structure in the turquoise and cobalt blue tilework on the facade."
    },
    "Tomb of Sikandar Lodi": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "Sikandar Lodi is known to be the second and the most significant ruler of the Lodi dynasty and ruled from 1489 to 1517. His tomb lies about 250m north of the Sheesh Gumbad."
    },
    "Athpula": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "This eight-pier bridge ('Ath' meaning 'eight') was built during Akbar's reign by Nawab Bahadur, to span a tributary of the Yamuna that probably met up with the Barahpula canal further south. The stream must have dried up at some point and part of it has now been replaced by a man-made reservoir.\nThis beautifully curving bridge built diagonally across the stream was originally known as  'Khairpur ka Pul' after the village of Khairpur in which it was located.",
      "CONSTRUCTION DETAILS": "Each of the eight piers supporting the seven arches of the bridge is nearly 2m in thickness. The central arch is the largest, and the others decrease in span from the center. The bridge spans a total length of 40m.",
      "WALL GATEWAY AND MOSQUE": "This small complex built during the late Mughal period consists of a tri-arched entrance gateway (above left) and a small mosque (above right) enclosed within a small garden.\nThe double storeyed gateway was finely plastered over Lakhori brick masonry (a Lakhori brick was slightly thinner and longer than a regular brick), and topped with a brick vaulted roof.\nThe single chambered mosque is rectangular in plan and crowned with three brick domes, with a courtyard on its eastern side."
    }
  },
  "Qutb Complex": {
    "Introduction": "Probably the oldest continuously inhabited region in Delhi, the area around the Qutb Complex, commonly known as Mehrauli, is the site of Delhi’s oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs in AD 1060.\nThe Turks invaded the city of Lal Kot in AD 1192 and with this brought in the Sultanate rule. The Quwwatul- Islam Mosque (1192) is a masterpiece of Indo-Muslim art and one of the oldest mosques in India.\nProbably the most significant building of early Sultanate rule is the Qutb Minar (A UNESCO World Heritage Site) built in the early part of the thirteenth century. Around the Qutb are important buildings like Iltutmish’s Tomb(1235), the magnificent Alai Darwaza (1310), and Alauddin’s Madrasa (1317) built by later sultans such as Iltutmish and Alauddin Khalji.\nAlauddin Khalji also started to build another minar, that was meant to overshadow the Qutb Minar completely. The construction of this building was abandoned after his death and today, only a rubble base known as the Alai Minar remains.",
    "Qila Lal Kot": "Lal Kot was built by the Rajput Tomar ruler Anang Pal II in the mid-eleventh century after they shifted from their previous settlement Suraj Kund. The Chauhan rule saw further expansion into the fortified area that became Qila Rai Pithora.\nA veneer of quartzite blocks on the walls is supported by rubble. The brick superstructure, a few remains of which can be seen was built either at this time or in the Sultanate period. One can also discern the ruins of gateways and bastion along the old walls.",
    "Late Mughal Garden and Sarai": "A map of 1876 indicates an important traverse route through the Qutb Complex connecting Delhi and Gurgaon. The garden belonging to the late Mughal era and the sarai (inn) within the Qutb Complex were probably built as a halting place for travellers to Delhi along this route. The complex also finds mention in early twentieth century descriptions as a rectangular, enclosed, late-Mughal garden with compartments, and a mosque in rubble masonry abutting the enclosing walls. Today the sarai stands at the entrance of the Qutb Complex with a lush green lawn in the centre, embellishing the space even more. The garden, currently closed for public, adjoins the sarai complex which comprises of an L-shaped series of enclosures that housed the travellers.",
    "Tomb of Imam Zamin": "East of the Alai Darwaza stands the tomb of Imam Zamin. A native of Turkestan, Zamin came to India during the reign of Sikandar Lodi (ad 1488–1517) and probably discharged important duties in connection with the Quwwat-ul- Islam Mosque. This striking tomb is typical of the Lodi period with sandstone piers filled in with lattice screens. The square chamber is surmounted by a dome of sandstone covered with plaster, rising from an octagonal drum.",
    "Alai Darwaza": "The Alai Darwaza was conceived to be the main gateway to the ambitious extension of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque undertaken by Alauddin Khalji in the early fourteenth century. Its four gateways, forming a square, are covered by a wide, bulging dome with a central knob, resting on horse-shoe shaped arches.",
    "Qutb Minar": "One of the great iconic buildings of the thirteenth century, this majestic cylindrical tower continues to be a symbol of fortitude and architectural brilliance of the country. Its construction marked the victory of the Turks over the indigenous Chauhan Dynasty. At the same time its style and embellishments represented the beginnings of an architectural style combining Indian and Central/West-Asian traditions.\nThe construction started during Sultan Aibak’s rule (1192–1210) who only lived to see the completion of the base and the first storey, 29 m high. The minar appears to have derived its name from its founder, Qutbuddin Aibak. Alternately, it is also believed that the minar was named in honour of a local saint Bakhtiyar Kaki, popularly known as Qutb Sahib who had greatly inspired Sultan Iltutmish (successor of Sultan Aibak).\nRising up to nearly 72.5 m, the tower tapers extensively from a diameter of 14 m at the base to approximately 3 m at the top, as an embellished inverted cone reaching the sky. A spiral staircase inside with nearly 379 steps leads to the top.\nBuilt in red sandstone, marble, and quartzite, all storeys are surrounded by a projected balcony encircling the minar that are supported by exquisitely carved stone brackets.",
    "Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque": "Quwwat-ul-Islam (‘Might of Islam’) Mosque, derives its name from the merit of being the first mosque built in Delhi after Islamic conquest at the end of the twelfth century, by Qutbuddin Aibak, the first sultan of the Slave Dynasty. Known to be the first building in the Qutb Complex, the mosque was built in a period of four years. The first set of boundaries were acquired over twenty-seven Hindu-Jain temples that were demolished as an act of war to establish the power of Ghurid Turk rule in the newly acquired city of Delhi.\nExpansion of the mosque continued after Aibak's death by his able son-in-law and General of the Army, Iltutmish, in 1230. Extension of the western screen wall from either side, enclosing the original boundaries and the Qutb Minar resulted in a space almost double the size of the original mosque.\nThe massive stone screen erected a few years later continues to be the only original Islamic element left in the mosque; consisting of a central corbelled arch, 6.7m wide and 16 m high, with two similar, smaller arches on either side. Constructed in rubble masonry, the arch is faced and profusely carved in red sandstone with exquisite floral patterns, verses of the Quran in Arabic calligraphy.",
    "The Iron Pillar": "Standing at the centre of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the Iron Pillar is undeniably amongst the most famous heritage attractions in Delhi.\nDating back to fourth century AD, the pillar bears a four-lined Brahmi inscription centrally along its length, that states that the pillar was installed by Chandragupta II  Vikramaditya, in honour of the Hindu god Vishnu.\nOriginally placed within a Vishnu Temple Complex at Udayagiri, the pillar for many unknown reasons was later moved to its current location. It is the oldest Hindu relic standing today in the sprawling Qutb Complex. Being a part of the complex even before Aibak’s conquest, the pillar perhaps stimulated the idea of a taller minar - the Qutb Minar.\nThis intriguing piece, a marvel of architecture and traditional knowledge, with its austerity and natural brilliance has never ceased to amaze archeologists, metallurgists, academicians, and of course tourists, for the way it has resisted corrosion through the last 1600 years.\nPlaced right in front of the prayer hall, embedded 1 m below the ground, the pillar stands 7.5 m high, weighing approximately 6.5 tons and is made of 98% wrought iron of the purest quality.\nThe pillar’s superior corrosion-resistance ability is attributed to the pure composition of iron, a high presence of phosphorous, and the method of casting. It is a testimony to the unique skill achieved by ancient Indian iron smiths",
    "Iltutmish’s Tomb": "This self-built tomb of the second ruler of the Slave Dynasty, Shamsuddin Iltutmish, was built in 1235. The structure sits along the north-west corner of the Qutb Complex, next to Iltutmish’s own extensions of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, and was one of the first tombs to be built in the city.\nThe tomb is 9 square meters in plan. Its sheer austerity on the exterior, is a striking contrast to the heavily decorated interior. Constructed in Delhi quartzite and faced with red sandstone, the tomb finds access from all three sides leaving the west wall for the prayer niche (mihrab) facing Mecca.\nThe space inside, faced in red sandstone, is profusely carved with Arabic inscriptions, geometrical and intricate arabesque patterns displaying a maturation of the early style evident in the Qutb Mosque. Here too however, Hindu designs like the lotus, kalash, and bandhanwar (floral door hangings), have been used as motifs.\nPlaced centrally over a raised platform is the main cenotaph in white marble with the burial chamber or the actual grave beneath the tomb.",
    "Alauddin Khalji’s Tomb and Madrasa": "Alauddin Khalji, the second sultan of the Turko-Afghan Khalji Dynasty, acquired many districts and undertook extensive construction in and around Delhi. Within the Qutb complex, the sultan was involved in the construction and conception of many structures including the Alai Minar, an extension of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, and its magnificent gateway - the Alai Darwaza. In his honour, the sultan's nobles gathered immediately after his death and constructed a tomb and madrasa in his name in AD 1316. A learning center in conjunction with a tomb and madrasa appears here for the first time, perhaps inspired by West-Asian traditions.\nThe complex sits at the back of the Qutb Complex, lying immediately to the south-west of Iltutmish's extension of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque.\nOriginally entered through the north, the madrasa with an L-shaped layout comprises a series of cell-like enclosures that functioned as schoolrooms. The madrasa is essentially a row of seven rooms, two of them domed, along the western edge of a rectangular court.\nThe square tomb is centrally placed towards the southern edge of the same court. With a pronounced entrance in the centre, the tomb is flanked on either side by chambers, seemingly smaller in scale, where perhaps rest the graves of Alauddin's family.",
    "Alai Minar": "This incomplete minar that lies within the northern boundaries of the Qutb Complex evidently symbolizes the supremacy and might of the sultan of the Khalji Dynasty, Alauddin Khalji. To commemorate his victory over his Deccan campaigns, the sultan dreamt of erecting a tower right opposite and twice the size of Qutb Minar inside the enclosure of the mosque.\nThe 24.5 m high minar of just a single storey remained unfinished after the sultan’s death in 1316."

  "Central Vista": {
    "INTRODUCTION": "Delhi has been, for centuries, a major centre of power. Like the numerous dynasties that had ruled Delhi over the years, the British realized the need to build their own city here, New Delhi. The India Office in London appointed two architects to design New Delhi - Edwin Landseer Lutyens and Herbert Baker.\nLutyens’ vision was to plan a city on lines similar to other great capitals of the world, with broad, long avenues flanked by sprawling lawns, impressive monuments punctuating the avenue, and the symbolic seat of power at the end. Lutyens found the perfect geographical location in the low Raisina Hill, west of Dinpanah (Purana Qila).\nThis hill became the focus of Lutyens’ and Baker’s plans for the new city. New Delhi was developed on a geometric design - mainly the use of hexagons and triangles - and had as its core the Central Vista.\nThe Central Vista ensemble has the main axis Rajpath (originally called Kingsway) that runs east-west, radiating from the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Raisina Hill, flanked by the secretariat buildings (North Block & South Block) and ends in the Princes’ Park which has the palaces of the erstwhile princely states in India.\nVijay Chowk marks the beginning of Rajpath and forms a cross axis at the foot of Raisina Hill. The road perpendicular to Rajpath at this point, leads to the Parliament House towards the North. Rajpath sweeps eastward to a hexagonal round–about that has the India Gate and Canopy. Another cross axis, the Janpath meets the Rajpath at the midpoint between the Secretariats and Princes’ Place.",
    "Rashtrapati Bhavan (1927)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "The Rashtrapati Bhavan or the ‘President’s House' or the ‘Presidential Palace’, situated on Raisina Hill, was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens for the residence of the Viceroy and Governor General of India, until 1950. It is now the residence of the President of India. This structure is a classical design that cohesively blended Western and Indian styles.\nIt is generally acknowledged as the World’s largest residential complex ever built for the Head of any Country. It has more than 300 rooms, 37 salons, 74 lobbies, 18 staircases and 37 fountains.",
      "LAYOUT": "Rashtrapati Bhavan was designed around a massive square with numerous courtyards and open areas within.",
      "ELEVATION": "It is a two storey building, the ground floor having monumental perforations. A grand colonnade of cream sandstone links sections of solid cream wall on the upper levels.",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "On the order of the then Viceroy, Lord Hardinge, many Indian elements were incorporated with Imperial architecture:  dome, carved stone elephants, metallic cobras around a fountain in the south court, small domed pavilions (chhatris), chhajjas and elegant floral-carved stone jalis. Interestingly, Lutyens used no steel in construction of this structure.\nLutyens designed another major component of the Rashtrapati Bhavan Estate: the Mughal Gardens covering 13 acres with more than 250 varieties of roses, and probably the world’s largest collection of marigold species, besides other flowers."
    },
    "Secretariat Building - North and South Block (1930s)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "While Lutyens was designing the Government House, Herbert Baker was working on the design of the Secretariat buildings. These buildings, two identical blocks facing each other across King’s Way, were to house (and still do) important ministries of the government.\nDifferences arose between Baker and Lutyens regarding the placement of the Secretariat and Government House. Despite that, however, Baker and Lutyens managed to create a harmonious set of buildings.",
      "LAYOUT AND ELEVATION": "The North and South Blocks sit on a plinth about 30 ft above the ground, covering an area of 1200 feet x 1300 feet.The buildings are arranged to form two squares. The two blocks are connected by an underground passage (still in use).",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "The two buildings of the Secretariat are made of buff and red sandstone and is a combination of European and indigenous architectural elements. The semi-circular arches, the Corinthian columns, and the baroque dome are unmistakably western; the carved elephants and lotuses, red sandstone jalis, chhajjas, and the chhatris on the terraces are just as obviously Indian.\nThe Secretariat Buildings have impressive and majestic interiors.The North Block contains some very well preserved paintings depicting themes like justice, war and peace. The South Block has paintings of different cities of the country and the emblems of old kingdoms."
    },
    "India Gate (1931)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "India Gate was initially planned to symbolize the gateway of Delhi for the British Leaders entering the palatial grounds of the Viceroy’s Palace. During World War I a large number of Indian soldiers died in the battle & the need for a War Memorial was felt. The foundation stone of the structure was laid in 1921 by the Duke of Connaught and it was completed in the year 1931.\nOver the decades, this has come to be a memorial for Indian soldiers in other wars as well, including the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971 and 1999. This is in addition to the names of soldiers awarded the Param Vir Chakra. In 1970, an eternal flame was installed underneath this arch in honour of the martyred soldiers. The shrine is known as the Amar Jawan Jyoti (literally, ‘flame of the immortal warrior’)",
      "LAYOUT": "It is built in the shape of a huge gateway mounted on a low red sandstone base. India Gate is an imitation of the Mughal Style of creating massive and impressive gateways situated at the peripherals of the Palace grounds.",
      "ELEVATION": "The roof of the arch rises in stages to a huge cornice, beneath which are inscribed Imperial suns. Above on both sides is inscribed INDIA. The 42.35m arch has a 10 m wide main opening with smaller openings on the sides. A flame is constantly lit in the center of the arch.",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "Topping the arch is a shallow dome with a bowl to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries to commemorate martyrs. A similar structure was installed under the arch afterwards as an eternal flame. This is in form of a plain square shrine of black marble atop a stepped platform of red sandstone: The Amar Jawan Jyoti, or the flame of the immortal soldier."
    },
    "Hyderabad House (1926)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "Of all the palaces that comprise Princes’ Park, by far the most splendid and the biggest was the Hyderabad House, that Sir Edwin Lutyens designed for Osman Ali Khan, the Nizam of Hyderabad\nAfter the death of Osman Ali Khan, his sons gifted the palace to the Indian government in 1947. Since then, Hyderabad House has been a Government of India property, used for important government events such as press conferences, banquets, and meetings.",
      "LAYOUT": "The plan is a butterfly shape with a central domed entrance hall with symmetrical wings radiating at 55 degrees. The interior is richly decorated.It has 36 rooms, four of which have now been converted into dining rooms. Hyderabad House also boasted of a zenana — quarters for women in purdah.",
      "ELEVATION": "The facade of the building is articulated by arcaded verandahs, prominent cornices and dholpur stone jallis."
    },
    "Baroda House (1936)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it was built for the Maharaja of Baroda. The Gaekwad of Baroda, wanted his palace  to be Anglo Saxon in style and so Lutyens has put in very few markedly Indian architectural elements.\nBaroda House today houses the headquarters of the Northern Railway.",
      "LAYOUT": "Baroda House is Anglo-Saxon in aspect and finishes, and here the butterfly plan is cut in two in the center. It has wings set at an angle of 57 degrees, a concave central porch and a circular salon. There are magnificent staircases leading to arcaded verandahs, loggias and courtyards.",
      "ELEVATION": "The building is of buff sandstone topped by a dome inspired from Sanchi stupa.",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "While the dome of Baroda House echoes the Sanchi Stupa, the rest of the palace is obviously Anglo-Saxon. It has large French windows with semi-circular arches; a portico; and unornamented Doric columns. The carved screens of the walls surrounding the terraces are European in style than the indigenous ornate jaali screens."
    },
    "Patiala House (1938)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "It was originally the palace of the Maharaja of Patiala. Patiala House in March 1997 was converted to become one of three court complexes in the city, and the criminal courts from Parliament Street were shifted here.",
      "LAYOUT": "A double storeyed building, the central portion is emphasized with a domed pavilion on the terrace and a projecting porch. Over the upper storey there is a projecting chajja running the entire length of the building.\nA dome joins the two wings of 'Lutyens's Butterfly Plan'.",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "The palace is painted cream, with sections of buff sandstone left bare to highlight balconies, parapets, and carved ventilator screens. An interesting feature is the distinctly Indian touch provided by a square, domed pavilion on the roof. With a chhajja and four smaller pavilions clustered around it."
    },
    "Jaipur House (1936)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "Designed by C.G. Blomfield and F.B. Blomfield in 1936 for the Maharaja of Jaipur. Like the Lutyens-designed palaces this too is a ‘butterfly plan’. Built mainly of buff sandstone, it displays distinct influences of the Art Deco & traditional Indian styles.\nJaipur House is today the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), inaugurated in 1954. The NGMA has a large display of art at present – primarily paintings, though there are also sculptures and some installation art – covering approximately 150 years of art in India.",
      "LAYOUT": "The butterfly shaped building has a central dome with two symmetrical wings radiating from the central court. Two similar wings radiate towards the back facing the garden. The facade of this palace is marked by two levels of small, vertical, slit like windows.",
      "ELEVATION": "The building is seated on a plinth with bands of red sandstone.A continuous chajja in red sandstone caps the entire facade.",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "The dome of the Jaipur House resembles the one on Rashtrapati Bhavan. A chhajja of red sandstone runs continuously below the roof.\nThe most distinct feature are multiple inlaid to form a patterned dado and Rajput columns  strips of red sandstone form arches openings along the façade."
    },
    "Bikaner House (1939)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "Sir Edwin Lutyens designed this palace in 1939, for Ganga Singh, the Maharaja of Bikaner. Bikaner House is now the office of Rajasthan Tourism.",
      "LAYOUT": "Bikaner House is a princely house spread over an 8 acre plot in Lutyens’ Delhi. It follows the geometry of a plot and is a half butterfly plan"
    },
    "National Stadium (1933)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "The stadium was built in 1933 as a gift for Delhi from the Maharaja of Bhavnagar, it was originally multipurpose stadium and named The Irwin Amphitheater. It was designed by R.T. Russel. In 1951 just before the Asian Games was hosted, it was renamed the National Stadium. In 2002, it was re-named the Dhyan Chand National Stadium, in honor of Major Dhyan Chand Singh (1905–1979), one of the world’s finest hockey players.",
      "LAYOUT": "The stadium is almost circular in plan and certain portions of the seating area have now been roofed.",
      "ELEVATION": "The entrance to the brick building is emphasized by four small canopies along the terrace parapet.",
      "ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "The building is a combination of western and Indian architectural styles. Prominent among the Indian elements are the chhajjas and the chhatris that stand above the arches. The chhatris, which look fairly out of place, are believed to have been suggested by Lady Willingdon, the Vicereine when the stadium was being constructed."
    },
    "Parliament House (1927)": {
      "INTRODUCTION": "With the Morley-Minto reforms of 1919, Indian representation in the Viceroy’s council suddenly rose. With it arose the need to construct a building large enough to accommodate the hundreds of members who would meet under one roof. What resulted was the Council House, today known as Sansad Bhavan or Parliament House.",
      "SPECIAL ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "As in the case of the Secretariat, at Parliament House too Baker used a combination of western and Indian architectural forms.\nThe dome, the semi-circular arched windows, and the towering columns of the verandahs surrounding the three chambers on two floors, are European. On the other hand, the geometric patterns that comprise the jalis of the boundary wall and the parapets echo Indo-Islamic architecture. The capitals of the pillars supporting the portico roof are also very Indian."
    },
    "Cathedral Church of Redemption (1930)": {
      "HISTORICAL BACKGROUND": "In the early 1900s, a number of British officers and bureaucrats who were living in the area that now comprises the heart of New Delhi, had no designated place of worship within the new city for Anglican services. All the church services were held at Alexandra Place (now Gole Dak Khana).\nRevd. T.R. Dixon, the chaplain at Delhi, put forward a request for a more permanent (and larger) church.\nThe design of Henry Alexander Medd was approved by Lutyens in 1925.\nThe Church of Redemption was consecrated and opened its doors on January 18, 1931. In April 1947, the church was elevated to the rank of a cathedral, the seat of the new Diocese of Delhi, part of the Church of North India (CNI).",
      "LAYOUT": "The cathedral is modeled on Venice’s Palladio Church and London’s Hampstead. It is approx. 53m x 37m and is built on a cross plan with the entry on the west and the altar to the east",
      "ELEVATION": "It has four floors with a large dome resting atop an octagonal drum, with sloping roofs spreading out to form a typical cruciform church. The dome also accomodates the bell. On each side of the central tower is a pedimented window.",
      "SPECIAL ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES": "It has a striking external appearance, with a large dome resting atop an octagonal drum, with sloping roofs spreading out to form a typical cruciform church.\nInside, too, the church is largely buff sandstone, with ornate Corinthian columns forming the bulk of the decoration. The high altar is of polished dark wood; just before the altar, facing the pews, is a stone plaque dedicated to Henry Alexander Nesbitt Medd.\nAmong the other interesting historic objects in the church are a fine old organ and a silver cross donated by Lord Irwin. The stained glass window in the tiny chapel on the right of the high altar is a recent addition."

    "LATER ADDITIONS TO THE IMPERIAL CORE OF NEW DELHI": {
      "National Museum (1949)": "The official inauguration of the museum was held on 15 August, 1949, under the aegis of the then Governor- General of India, C.Rajagopalachari. The buff sandstone building is arranged in the form of a series of galleries, spreading out on three sides of a central, circular well-like space.\nThree floors of galleries hold an extensive collection of exhibits: a range of ancient Indian sculpture, manuscripts, jewellery, medieval art, tribal art, Central Asian artefacts, pre-Columbian and western art, weaponry, musical instruments, coins, etc. The museum also holds special temporary exhibitions, often with priceless exhibits being brought in from international museums.",
      "Ministry of External Affairs": "Also called Jawaharlal Nehru Bhawan, it was designed to be in harmony with its neighbouring Lutyens’ buildings and the city’s environment. It marks a changing trend in construction practices in that it is the first government building with a LEEDS Green Building Certification.The stone clad building’s envelope is made of composite brick and stone masonry with insulation cavity.",
      "The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts: IGNCA (1987)": "The IGNCA was set up in 1987, as an autonomous body under the Ministry of Culture. It has since devoted itself to the preservation and propagation of the arts.",
      "National Archives (1999)": "Earlier named the Imperial Record Office, has a distinct facade. Its Neo Classical elements  are balanced in their proportions, and its grand verandah features columns of the Delhi Order.\nNew  wings have been added to the original structure designed by Lutyens. These later additions  are placed away from the plot edges and are in strong contrast to the earlier structure."

  "Hauz Khas Complex": {
    "INTRODUCTION": "This complex borders the tank known originally as the Hauz-e -Alai, which was constructed during the reign of the emperor Alauddin Khalji (reigned 1296-1316) in the early 1300s. It lay somewhat to the west of Alauddin’s newly fortified capital of Siri. The rainwater that would collect in it mainly during the monsoon would then be used year round by the people in the neighbourhood. In the years after Alauddin, lack of maintenance led to a silting up of the channels that fed the tank and it dried up.\nIn the 1350s the emperor Firoz Shah Tughlaq (reigned 1351-88) had the water supply to the tank restored.  The tank now came to be known as the Hauz Khas or royal tank. At the same time Firoz Shah also built around the south-western edge of the tank the Madrasa-e-Firuz Shahi or ‘college of Firoz Shah’ - an institution of higher education endowed by the emperor himself.  It employed teachers who were scholars of note and attracted students from far and wide, giving them generous stipends during their period of study.\nThe importance of this site is also evident from the fact that Firoz Shah chose to have his own tomb built at a focal point in the complex. The college buildings were arranged in an L-shape around the south-eastern corner of the Hauz Khas, giving the rooms a good view over the expanse of water.  The connection between the buildings and the tank was strengthened by the several sets of steps leading down from the college to the tank. On the other side the buildings were edged by a beautiful garden. 14th century visitors invariably described the buildings and their setting in glowing terms.",
    "Three Domed Building": "This unusual T-shaped building is a bit of a puzzle because its functionality is not known. While some say it was a tomb with many graves inside, there are no traces of graves now in it.\nFrom its size and shape it seems not unlikely that it was a meeting place or assembly room, designed to hold a bigger group than would normally gather for classes.After the madrasa fell into disuse following the decline of the Tughlaq dynasty, this building came to be used as a residence by the villagers of the surrounding area.",
    "Firoz Shah's Tomb": "Though Firoz Shah died in 1388, he built his tomb at the same time as the madrasa, in the 1350s. The tomb forms the junction of the two wings of the college, and the top of its dome is the highest point of the entire complex. The inscription on the southern entrance tells us that repairs to the building were carried out under the orders of the emperor Sikandar Lodi in the year 1508.",
    "Tughlaq Tombs": "The pavilions that stand in the garden of the madrasa are mostly tombs, maybe containing the remains of teachers of the madrasa. They are of a similar ornamentation though their plans are different – eight sided, six sided or square.\nSome of them have a shallowly marked grave in the centre. It is possible that though tombs, they were designed so that pupils could sit there and study – in the shade. The two smallest pavilions have very heavy projecting stone beams just under the dome. It is possible that they were part of a larger building or buildings.",
    "Mosque": "This mosque would have functioned as a place for prayer for those who lived and worked in the madrasa. Though quite ruined, its structure and very unusual style can still be made out.\nIn most mosques the western wall has no openings and is usually marked by arched niches, called mihrabs. In this mosque however, the western wall has decorative windows that overlook the tank, and steps that lead down to the water.",
    "Madrasa West Wing": "This wing of the madrasa has open pillared rooms at the top storey and arcaded rooms in the lower storey. Also in the lower storey one can see small dark cells which were probably accommodation for students. Inside there are narrow openings for light and air, and small storage niches.\nIn front of these cells there were arcaded rooms which have now fallen down. At the western-most end of this wing there is a large domed building with two storeys. The area in front of this building was originally a courtyard with two buildings that face each other and flank the large domed building.",
    "Madrasa North Wing": "This wing of the college buildings has pillared rooms on the top storey and arcaded rooms below.  The rooms overlook the tank and would have provided a beautiful view. The top storey rooms overlooked the garden.\nThe buildings of the college are built of rubble masonry combined with blocks of neatly cut quartzite. Much of the exterior was originally covered in white plaster and painted in bright colours, with golden domes. The ornamentation consists primarily of some incised plasterwork and simple carving.",
    "Royal Tank": "Originally called Hauz e Alai, this tank was excavated under the orders of the emperor Alauddin Khalji (1296-1316) for the use of the inhabitants of Siri, the city founded by him.  After the end of the Khalji dynasty however, the channels leading into it got silted up and the tank dried up.  Firoz Shah then in the mid-fourteenth century restored the water supply to the tank and built a madrasa or college around it.  Originally the tank was much larger than it is today, and the ruined pavilion (called Munda gumbad) on a mound in the north-west corner of the tank was in the middle of the water."

  "Baolis of Delhi": {
    "Introduction to Baolis": "Water has always played an important role in the day-to-day life of  every man. The need to tap ground water, store rain water, and to make it accessible to the human population has led to the construction of several tanks, wells and baolis, which also became an epitome of the art and architecture of the local people.\nWe hear stories of kings leaving behind their palaces due to lack of water; Fatehpur Sikri and Tughlaqabad are good examples. Most kings established their capitals on the banks of rivers. Delhi has the Yamuna flowing through it, and has been capital seven times. At one time Delhi had about 100 or more baolis, of which only thirty have survived. Many were lost over the years, while some were discovered, preserved and restored.\nA baoli is a reservoir in which water can be stored. It is also a source of ground water. Numerous tanks and baolis were commissioned by the ruling clans in which water was collected mainly during the rainy season and was then used throughout the year by the people in the neighbourhood.\nSeparate baolis were constructed for drinking and bathing purposes. Baolis were often constructed close to mosques and temples. People washed and bathed before prayers. Some Hindu ceremonies were performed at the baolis by women, who prayed and made their offerings here.\nAs the name suggests, the step-well has a series of steps which lead down to the ground level where the water is stored. The steps also enabled accessibility to water during summers when the water level went down.  In India, baolis are mainly found in the arid north-western region due to the scarcity of water there.\nSome baolis were designed only for the purpose of water storage, others to provide shelter to travellers and caravans. These baolis were designed with rooms on the higher floors, with a dalan (colonnaded veranda) supported on columns. Such step-wells were also used as shaded spaces for social interaction where discussions could be held.\nThe architectural form of a baoli mainly consists of three elements: the well in which the water is collected, the flight of steps to reach the ground water through several stories, and intermediate pavilions. Baolis have a history that goes back several millennia. The Great Bath at Mohenjodaro, which was built more than 4,000 years ago,may be considered a form of baoli as it also consisted of a tank fed by a well and accessed by steps.\nThe oldest existing primitive form of baoli in Delhi - Anangtal in Mehrauli - was built in the tenth century by the Tomar king Anang Pal II. More appropriately called a tank, it was built when the city Lal Kot was founded. Some important extant baolis in Delhi include Gandhak ki Baoli,Rajon ki Baoli, Agrasen ki Baoli, the baoli at Purana Qila, and the baoli at Firoz Shah Kotla.\nThrough the passage of time, baolis not only became the main source of drinking water but also a cool sanctuary for prayers, meditation, bathing, and other such multiple forms of relaxation and recreation. This system of water collection was further modified with the advent of Islam in terms of its architecture and decorative elements. The nineteenth century saw a fast decline in the use of step-wells as the British felt these to be unhygienic sources of water and started using pipelines.",
    "Gandhak ki Baoli ": "This is one of the oldest baolis in Delhi, lying about 100m south of Adham Khan’s Tomb (Emperor Akbar’s wet nurse Maham Anagah’s son) in the Mehrauli village. It was built by Iltutmish for Sufi saint Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki. The baoli is known as Gandhak ki Baoli because of its water which smells like gandhak, meaning sulphur. This baoli once supplied water to the area and was considered sacred. It is a five-tiered structure which includes a circular well on its southern side. The water in the well was reserved only for the purpose of cooking and drinking. The area is surrounded by a lush green forest. The entrance arch of the baoli has a staircase enclosed within the walls as staircases were considered to be an unaesthetic component in a building.",
    "Baoli at Hazarat Nizamuddin's Dargah (1321-1322)": "The baoli or stepwell of Nizamuddin Auliya, can be approached either through the shrine complex or from the north. Once also known as Chashma Dilkusha (‘heart uplifting spring’), the baoli is surrounded by walls on three sides, with steps built down to the level of the water on the north side.\nThe baoli was constructed under the supervision of Nizamuddin himself, and its water therefore is believed to be sacred and to have curative powers. There is an interesting story behind the construction of the well. The building of the baoli had become the major bone of contention between Nizamuddin and the then ruler of Delhi, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq. The emperor was at that time building his citadel at Tughlaqabad, and he summarily forbade all labourers in Delhi from working during the day at any site other than Tughlaqabad.\nThe labourers, however, held Nizamuddin in such esteem that they got around Ghiyasuddin’s ban by working on the baoli’s construction at night – which immediately made Ghiyasuddin ban the sale of oil which was used in lamps. The story goes that the baoli was finally completed by labourers working by moonlight. Another story has it that the workers used the water of the baoli instead of oil, and effectively enough. Whichever tale you believe, it’s enchanting enough to merit a visit.",
    "Firoz Shah Kotla Baoli (1354)": "In front of the Pyramid of Cells, and separated from it by a stretch of neat lawn, is the round stepwell or baoli of Firoz Shah Kotla. The outer wall of the baoli has arched recesses, and the baoli itself is three storeys deep, with a staircase descending down to the water level at the western end. The water from the baoli is nowadays pumped up to irrigate the gardens of Firoz Shah Kotla.\nThe baoli is off limits to the public, because of past accidents where visitors fell in. A high fence encircles the entire well, and permission is required from the ASI office at the main gate of the citadel to obtain a closer look.",
    "Hindu Rao Baoli": "A little further down from the Pir Ghaib, is a ruined baoli that must have been part of Firoz Shah’s hunting lodge. Although completely dry most of the year, the baoli fills up during the monsoon. The access to the Baoli is now blocked, but from above it appears to be a fairly deep structure, the exact extent of which is difficult to determine. The walls of the baoli are made of random rubble masonry, mostly covered with vegetation now. At the very bottom of the well, there are known to be some obvious Tughlaq features such as a wall and double pillars which must have been part of the chambers surrounding the well. Above this level, there is evidence of a tunnel, approximately 193m long that leads from the north end. The purpose of this tunnel, which was 2.15m high with ventilation shafts and doorways, is unknown.",
    "Agrasen ki Baoli": "Among the buildings that already existed in the area when Lutyens’ New Delhi was laid out, one of the most prominent was the fifteenth century baoli of Agrasen (alternately known as Ugrasen). As its name suggests, the baoli is believed, according to legend, to have been built by an ancient king Raja Agrasen. There is no historical evidence in support of this legend, but the baoli was repaired and rebuilt during the fourteenth century by the Agrawal community, which is supposedly descended from Agrasen. Wealthy Agrawal merchants donated in both cash and kind (the latter in the form of building material) for the renovation of the baoli, which stands near present day Connaught Place, within easy walking distance of Jantar Mantar.",
    "Rajon ki Baoli": "Located within the Mehrauli Archaeological Park, about 400 m away from the Gandhak ki Baoli, this is a three-storeyed step-well built during the Lodi period. The name of Rajon ki Baoli is derived from its functionality as the baoli (step-well) was used by masons (raj) for some time. The water in the baoli was meant for cooking and drinking purposes.\nBuilt as a four-level rectangular tank with steps at one end and a circular well at the other, the baoli also has long covered corridors or 'dalans' along the sides of the tank with arches beautifully decorated with incised limestone plaster. Another decorative feature is carved brackets that support the overhang or 'chhajja' below the parapet. There are rooms behind this arcade, which would no doubt have given shade and shelter to visitors to the step-well.",
    "Baoli at Purana Qila ": "The baoli at Purana Qila lies between the Qila-e- Kohna Masjid and Sher Mandal. It is an interesting example of medieval water management. Stepwells like this one were typically fed by rainwater, sometimes supplemented by water from underground springs. A series of steps – in this case, eighty nine – separated by landings (this baoli has eight of them) lead down to the stepwell, allowing people to descend to the baoli to fetch water. Typically (as you’ll see in this baoli), the water was covered over with a roof to reduce evaporation and to keep the baoli clean.\nThe baoli is made mainly out of Delhi quartzite stone. It is closed to visitors, so one cannot go down to the water, but the fence surrounding the baoli is low enough to allow a glimpse of most of it. The water is now stagnant and dirty, but the well beyond – on the north-eastern end of the baoli – is still in use."

  "Firoz Shah Kotla": {
    "INTRODUCTION": "Firoz Shah Kotla is the core of the city of Firozabad, established in 1354 as an imperial capital by the emperor Firoz Shah Tughlaq. Firozabad was an extensive city. According to the historian Shams Siraj Afif, who lived during Feroz Shah’s reign, the buildings of the city stretched in the north as far as the palace or hunting lodge constructed by Firoz Shah on the Northern Ridge (known today as Pir Ghaib). To the south the city extended to the site now marked by the Purana Qila or Old Fort.  It also grew to be quite populous, and might have contained a population of some 150,000.\nThe earlier sites of substantial settlement in Delhi had been further south – Lal Kot/Qila Rai Pithora (now the area around the Qutub Minar), Siri a little to its north-east, and Tughlaqabad in the hills to the south-east. Firozabad was not only much further north than these three early settlements, it was also the first of the capitals to be built on the bank of the river Yamuna.\nFiroz Shah Kotla was the royal citadel of the city and as such it has some important buildings.  In the 14th century it was very grand and opulent.  Visitors such as the invader Timur, as well as other contemporary chroniclers have left behind glowing descriptions of its buildings. None of the costly stones and gilded and painted features described by them exist today. Apart from the vagaries of time the hand of man is responsible for this ruin. Building materials were plundered from here in later centuries for construction work for the cities to the south (Dinpanah and Shergarh) and to the north (Shahjahanabad). Ironically, material for the construction of Firozabad itself had come from some older cities like Siri, Jahanpanah and Lal Kot.",
    "Gateway and Palace Ruins": "The walls of the citadel have a slight slope or batter on the outside. The top parapets or merlons have now disappeared; the arrow slits can however still be seen. On the inside, the ruins suggest that the gateway structure was once quite elaborate and would have had a large arcaded space on either side of the main entrance way. The material used in the construction is rough stones held together by mortar. It is likely that the surfaces were at one time covered by a fine limestone plaster which might have been decorated by carving and painting in various colours.\nHistorians from the time of Firoz Shah listed many buildings in the fortress. There was ‘the palace of the clayey court’, which was meant for the emperor’s court attended by nobles, officials and distinguished literary men. ‘The palace of the wooden gallery/overhang’ was for the officers of the emperor, and the ‘central quadrangle’ or the ‘palace of the public court’, was where the emperor held court for the general public. The more private areas, meant for the residence of the emperor and his family, have not been mentioned but must also have existed. The buildings are too ruined to be identified individually.",
    "Baoli": "The baoli or well would have been an essential source of water for the citadel. Unlike more common step-wells this does not have steps leading down to the level of the water.  The circular well, open to the sky, has provision to lift water in a bucket on a pulley. Around this well two storeys of rooms are arranged. A complex system of pipes and channels pumped the water to the roof and from there to the outside, where presumably even animals could have drunk from it. The roof, topped by chhatris and surrounded by a railing, was probably a recreational space.",
    "Pyramid of Cells": "This building was specially commissioned by Firoz Shah to hold the pillar he had transported to Delhi from Topra, near Ambala. This had originally been set up there by the great 3rd century emperor Ashoka, who had several edicts regarding his principles of government inscribed on it.\nUnder Firoz Shah’s orders this was brought to Delhi with great effort, and erected here. It was crowned by a capital of coloured stones and a golden globe with a crescent on top.\nThe building, now in ruins, originally had a railing and eight domed chhatris at the top, and a stone lion at each corner.",
    "Jami Masjid": "The main congregational mosque of the citadel is now ruined but was in its time quite spectacular. The doorway was decorated with carved stones, which have since been plundered. In the middle of the courtyard was an octagonal domed structure on which a document known as the ‘Futuhat e Firoz Shahi’ was inscribed, listing the great works and achievements of the emperor. Timur was so impressed by this mosque that he is said to have had a similar mosque built in his capital Samarqand, putting to work craftsmen taken from India. An interesting feature is the chambers at the lower level."

  "Purana Qila": {
    "INTRODUCTION": "The Purana Qila, literally ‘old fort’, is located on a site which has a long history of habitation.  Excavations have revealed definite layers from the fourth/third centuries B.C., and pottery fragments that could date from an era approximately 1000 -500 B.C.  Popular tradition in fact links the site to the ancient city of Indraprastha, described in the epic, the Mahabrarata, as having been founded by the Pandava brothers on the banks of the river Yamuna. Though the epic itself talks of the subsequent abandonment of the city, the memory of the place name lived on in the later village of ‘Indarpat’ – that was within these walls till the beginning of the twentieth century.\nIn 1533, the second Mughal emperor Humayun (reigned 1530-40 and 1555-56), decided to build on this spot a fort that was called Dinpanah – the ‘refuge of the faith’. It is believed that the walls and gates of the fort were completed within a year, and it is not unlikely that many other buildings were added in the next few years. Humayun’s reign was interrupted in 1540 when Sher Shah Sur, the Afghan-origin chieftain from eastern India, ousted Humayun from the throne to capture Delhi and the Indian empire. Sher Shah and his successor ruled till 1555, when Humayun returned to reclaim the throne back but then died within a few months of it.\nThe walls of the fort form a rectangle with a perimeter of about 1.9 kilometers. The eastern side was originally bounded by the Yamuna, but the river has long since changed its course eastwards. Apart from the imposing gateways, very few buildings still remain within the fort. An ambiguous historical record makes it difficult for us to say for sure which of the structures of the fort were commissioned by Humayun and which by Sher Shah and Islam Shah.",
    "Bada Darwaza": "This western entrance to the fortress was most probably built under Humayun, as it is part of the main fortifications. On either side of it are bastions which, along with the curtain wall beyond, have arrow/gun slits.  Kanguras or merlons would originally have run along the top of the entire length of the wall, but have now completely disappeared except at the top of one of the bastions. The surface ornamentation of the gate consists of inlay patterns in sandstone and marble, some stone carving and tile work.  Decorative jharokhas (balcony windows) and chhatris (pillared kiosks) also serve a decorative purpose.",
    "Talaaqi Darwaza": "The northern gate of the fort is a tall and imposing structure.  It has entrance ways on two levels – the lower originally being at the level of the water.  The upper entrance way seems to have been the main way in, as it is more ornamented.  If so, a drawbridge or causeway must have connected it to the land on the other side of the moat that encircled the fort. Decorative features include sandstone and marble inlay, carving, tile work, jharokhas (balcony windows) and chhatris (pillared kiosks).  There is no credible explanation for the origins of the name, which literally means ‘forbidden gate’.",
    "Qila-i-Kohna Masjid": "The name of this building literally means ‘the mosque of the old fort’ and it was the congregational mosque of the fort. Its construction is usually attributed to Sher Shah. The profuse decoration includes stone inlay using red and yellow sandstone and white and black marble, stone carving, and tile work. The mosque faces away from the inside of the citadel, because it is oriented towards the west which, being the direction of Mecca, is the direction of prayer.",
    "Baoli": "This baoli or step well was a source of water for the inhabitants of the fort.  Given the height on which the fort is built, the ground water would have been quite far down, so this is a deep well.  A narrow flight of 89 steps, separated by 8 landings, lead down to the water, which could also be drawn up with a bucket from a conventional well at the other end.  Step wells were constructed so that people could go down to the level of the water.  The building kept the water was covered, to keep it clean and minimize evaporation.",
    "Sher Mandal": "The name of this octagonal building suggests that it was built by Sher Shah, but in style it has parallels in descriptions and images of early Mughal pavilions. The lower storey is mostly solid, with stairs leading to the upper storey.  At the centre of the upper storey is a small room.  At the very top of the building is a domed chhatri or pavilion.  On 20 January 1556 Humayun was on the roof of this building when he heard the call to prayer. In a hurry to descend, he fell down the stairs, was grievously hurt, and succumbed to his injuries three days later.",
    "Hammam": "This ruined brick structure is all that remains of a hammam or bath house. The remains of terracotta pipes and a ribbed water chute can still be seen.  Such bath houses, with provision for hot and cold water and even steam rooms, were a particularly important part of Mughal culture. In the years after the abandonment of the fort as a capital of the empire, this structure was forgotten and built over.  It was revealed beneath a hut when the clearance of the village of Indarpat and conservation of the site was undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1913-14.",
    "Humayun Darwaza": "Though called the Humayun Darwaza, this gate is attributed by some to Sher Shah on the basis of a fading inscription in ink that was found in one of the rooms on the upper storey.  There are two entrance ways, one on top of the other.  The lower one opened at the level of the water in the moat, while the upper would have been approached via a drawbridge or causeway from across the moat.  Decorations include inlay work and carving in sandstone and marble, and tilework. The decorative merlons on top might originally have existed over the other gates of the fort too.",
    "Archaeological Museum": "The building in which the museum is housed is part of the inner walls of the fort.  Original plaster decoration can still be seen, particularly on the vaulted ceiling.  The exhibits tell the history of Delhi, as revealed in excavations in the Purana Qila and elsewhere in Delhi too.\nInside there are artefacts unearthed during excavation – pottery, figurines, glassware, tiles, Mughal period Chinese porcelain, etc.",
    "Lal Darwaza": "This gateway is believed by some to mark the southern edge of Sher Shah’s city of Shergarh, though some contend that Shergarh extended much further south. The precise extent of the city is not clear from historical records. In any event the arrangement of the gate and the fortified wall attached to it makes it clear that it was the south facing gate of some walled area.  On either side of the road leading south from the gate, there are remains of arcades that might have been rows of shops.  Ornamental stone inlay and tile work are the main surface decoration.",
    "Khairul Manazil": "The Khairul Manazil (literally the 'most auspicious of houses') was built in 1561-1562 by Maham Angah, one of the wet nurses of Akbar, to house a mosque and a madrasa (a school of learning).\nThe complex is laid around a central courtyard with a shallow tank, and consists of the mosque spread across five bays, double-storeyed colonnades housing the madrasa, and an impressive arched gateway."

  "Red Fort": {
    "INTRODUCTION": "Shahjahanabad was the imperial city founded in the mid 1600s when, having more or less completed his magnum opus, the Taj Mahal, the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan shifted his capital from Agra to Delhi.\nShahjahan’s shifting of the imperial capital to Delhi necessitated the building of a fortress to house the court – a court which was wealthy enough to be rivalled by only that of the Ming emperors of China. To showcase this wealth, and of course to show off his own undoubtedly refined aesthetic sense, Shahjahan built the Lal Qila (literally, the `red fort’, named for the deep red sandstone walls that surround it). The fort, also known as the Qila-e-Shahjahanabad and the Qila-e-Mubarak, was designed by the master-builders Ustad Hamid and Ustad Ahmed. Construction began in 1639 and ended in 1648, though additions continued into as late as the 19th century.\nToday, only a part of the Red Fort’s original buildings remain; the rest were destroyed during the period after British troops occupied the fort in 1857. There is, however, enough left to give some idea of the grandeur of this splendid citadel.\nAn oblong, irregular octagon in shape, the Red Fort has a perimeter of 2.41 km and is pierced by two main gates, the Lahore Gate and the Delhi Gate (not to be confused with the Delhi Gate of the city further south). Although the Yamuna has now shifted its course, in Shahjahan’s time it flowed along the Red Fort and water was channelled from it into the moat that surrounds the fort. The main palaces – those occupied by the royal family – were situated along what was then the river front.",
    "Lahore Gate": "This gate consists of three separate sections. The bridge which leads to the entrance of the fort was built for Emperor Akbar II (r.1806-37). Shahjahan’s successor Aurangzeb added the 10.5m high barbican: the fortification enclosing the Lahore Gate and making its approach less straightforward.\nBeyond the barbican, and at right angles to it, stands the Lahore Gate itself, a three-storeyed structure of red sandstone flanked on either side by half-octagonal turrets topped by open pavilions. This central portion of the gateway is a style Shahjahan used commonly in his gateways: a row of small chhatris, each topped by a white marble dome, and with a minaret at either end of the row. The Delhi Gate, facing south, is very similar in design to the Lahore Gate.",
    "Chhatta Chowk": "Just beyond the Lahore Gate lies the market that is today known as Chhatta Chowk, but in Shahjahan’s time was also known as Meena Bazaar or the Bazaar-e-Musakkaf.\nIn the 17th century, the shops along this covered, vaulted arcade sold relatively exotic wares: midgets, eunuchs, jewellery, brocades, etc. Today, they cater exclusively to souvenir-seeking tourists. If you make your way to the centre of the arcade, where an octagonal open court lets in sunlight, you can still see traces of the original decoration in the form of incised plaster.",
    "Naubat Khana": "Past the Chhatta Chowk is the Naubat Khana, or Naqqar Khana, the drum house. Built in 1639-48, the Naubat Khana originally housed the music gallery and was the main entrance to the Diwan-e-Aam. Musicians sat in the Naubat Khana and would play drums throughout the day on special occasions like the emperor’s birthday, five times a day if the emperor was in residence and thrice if he was travelling.\nOriginally there was a walled square in front of the Naubat Khana, with a tank in the middle and openings to a north-south bazaar street leading to the Delhi Gate on one side and to the north of the complex on the other. A channel of water ran down the length of this street. Visitors would alight in this square, leaving their carriages, palanquins, horses and elephants here. For this reason this was also known as Hathi Pol or ‘Elephant Gate’.\nUpstairs, the music gallery of the Naubat Khana has been converted into the War Memorial Museum, with exhibits ranging from Mughal to World War I battles – you’ll see impressive old swords, shields, maces, powder horns and armour from Mughal times. The World War I section has an eclectic display, of guns, uniforms, badges, military decorations photographs, flags etc.",
    "Diwan-e-Aam": "Beyond the Naubat Khana, a pathway flanked by lawns leads to the Diwan-e- Aam, the Hall of Public Audience, where the Mughal emperors would receive the general public and hear their petitions and complaints. The Diwan-e-Aam too originally had a large square before it, surrounded by arcaded apartments. The Diwan-e-Aam is a striking, beautifully symmetrical palace with open sides and front, made of red sandstone. The hall was originally covered with polished white shell lime plaster, with gilded ceiling and columns, and railings of gold and silver separating the rank and file from the nobility.\nThe highlight of the hall is the magnificent white marble throne that stands in the centre of the eastern wall. The throne is exquisitely decorated, with a curving Bangalda or whaleback roof, and carvings of flowers, particularly daffodils, all along the lower front of the structure. The wall behind the throne is inlaid in very fine and extensive pietra dura work depicting trees, flowers and birds. These decorative panels, much damaged and partly removed and carried off to England after 1857, were restored in the early 1900’s by an Italian artisan named Menegatti.",
    "Mumtaz Mahal": "The Mumtaz Mahal was originally a part of the imperial seraglio. After the revolt of 1857 it was used as a prison, and later as a sergeant’s mess. It now houses the Archaeological Museum, an interesting collection of artefacts from the Mughal era like, fine samples of calligraphy, farmaans or royal edicts by Jahangir, Shahjahan, Aurangzeb and Sultan Abu Sayyid, the grandfather of Babur, the first Mughal emperor. There are old books (a 14th century Quran and a copy of Firdausi’s Shah Nama), some fine paintings etc.",
    "Rang Mahal": "Originally named for the paint work that decorated its walls (`rang’ means `colour’), as well as the colourful social life of its interior, the Rang Mahal was the chief building of the imperial seraglio. The palace, made of white marble and shell plaster, was also known as the Imtiyaz Mahal (the `palace of distinction’). In Shahjahan’s time it was ablaze with paint and mirrorwork, its length partitioned by heavy drapes. A wide, shallow water channel ran through it, with a central marble basin carved into the floor. Under the Rang Mahal was a tehkhana or basement, to which the ladies of the seraglio would move in the hot summer days.\nAfter 1857, the Rang Mahal was taken over by the military, and served as the mess room for the regiment stationed at the fort. Today, a small chamber inlaid with fine mirrorwork still survives, fine strips of silvery mirror forming arabesques and geometrical patterns on the ceiling and upper walls.",
    "Khaas Mahal": "Khaas Mahal, the private palace of the emperor, showcases finely carved white marble throughout. Exquisite jali (screen) work and the depiction of the scales of justice are present on the northern side of the Khwabgah (sleeping chamber), which also has beautifully worked metal doors, carved all over in a pattern of flowers, with unusual doorknobs in the shape of elephants with mahouts (person who drives an elephant) sitting atop them.\nAt the east end of the Khaas Mahal is the Musamman Burj, a semi-octagonal tower with carved marble jalis and a jharokha (oriel window) in the centre. The Musamman Burj was originally topped with a dome of gilded copper – what you see today was put in by the British after 1857. The jharokha of the Musamman Burj was known as the jharokha-e-darshan, where the emperor would appear at sunrise daily to show himself to his subjects.",
    "Diwan-e-Khaas": "The Diwan-e-Khaas, or the ‘Hall of Private Audience’, where the emperor met with his most select courtiers, is by far the most ornate of the Red Fort’s many palaces. Unlike the Diwan-e-Aam, this hall is made completely of white marble and was originally embellished with carving, gilt and fine pietra dura inlay. In its heyday the Diwan-e-Khaas was carpeted, replete with mirrors and gold-embroidered curtains, and with a vast canopy of red cloth stretching across the front. Towards the back of the hall, on a marble platform, sat the legendary Takht-e-Taawus, the Peacock Throne.\nThe Peacock Throne was described by the French jeweller and traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier as being surmounted by a `peacock with elevated tail made of blue sapphires and other coloured stones, the body being of gold inlaid with precious stones, having a large ruby in front of the breast, from whence hangs a pear-shaped pearl of 50 carats or thereabouts…’. The Peacock Throne was carried off by the invader Nadir Shah in 1739.",
    "Hammam": "Near the Khaas Mahal and Diwan-e-Khaas stands an otherwise nondescript building, completely closed and with only a couple of glass windows on each side that allow visitors to peep in. Here you will be able to see some signs of what was once a favourite chamber for the Mughal emperors: the Hammam or bathhouse. The Hammam was traditionally a place where the emperor not just had his bath, but also often discussed important matters of state with the courtiers who attended him.\nThe Hammam comprises three main chambers, intersected by corridors, with a central basin for hot and cold baths. The interiors of the Hammam are of white marble decorated with pietra dura inlays and carving and a floor with pretty floral designs.",
    "Hira Mahal": "Beyond the Hammam is a four-sided pavilion of white marble, known as Hira Mahal. This small, simple, and sparingly decorated structure was built in 1842, during the lean times when the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II survived on a pension given by the East India Company’s government in India.",
    "Shah Burj": "At the far end of the line of buildings along the wall stands Shah Burj, which consists of two distinct sections. At the angle formed by the northern and eastern walls of the fort is the actual burj, the tower. This was originally a domed building, but the dome was destroyed in the aftermath of 1857.\nWhat is seen of Shah Burj today is just about a century old; the structure was seriously damaged in an earthquake in 1904, as a result of which it had to be rebuilt almost from scratch. Attached to this is a five-arched pavilion of white marble supported on fluted columns and with low whaleback roofs.\nOriginally, the Shah Burj was the point from which water was distributed throughout the fort. Water was pumped up from the river, and at least in later times, also came in a stream through an opening in the western wall.\nThe water flowed down a carved white marble cascade (which can still be seen), and then into the channel known as the Nahar-i-Bihisht, the `Stream of Paradise’, which flowed through the buildings and palaces of the fort.",
    "Moti Masjid": "Next to the Hammam, and like it, off limits to visitors, is the ‘pearl mosque’ that was built in 1659-60 by Aurangzeb, the son and successor of Shahjahan. It is a small three-domed mosque dressed with white marble and used as a private chapel by the Mughal emperors and the ladies of their household. The Moti Masjid is surrounded by a high wall that hides the building effectively. The domes that are visible above are not quite original – they were initially covered with gilded copper plates that were badly damaged in 1857. Later repairs, in the wake of the revolt, did away with the copper and gilt.",
    "Sawan and Bhadon Pavilions": "At either end of the Hayat Baksh Bagh are two almost identical open pavilions of carved white marble, facing each other across the water channel that runs from one to the other. The two pavilions are named Sawan and Bhado, after the two rainy months in the Hindu calendar.\nBoth pavilions are beautifully carved, and of particular interest is the wall of small arched niches behind what would have been a cascade of water. In these niches lit lamps were placed at night, and vases of golden flowers during the day, and the effect of water flowing in front of these in a fine, shimmering curtain must have been quite picturesque.",
    "Zafar Mahal and Tank": "Zafar Mahal stands in the middle of a four-sided tank (constructed almost completely of red sandstone). Though the tank was part of the original construction of the fort, Zafar Mahal was added two hundred years later, in 1842 by Bahadur Shah Zafar, who also added a parapet to the tank. A bridge originally connected the pavilion to the edge of the tank. Incidentally, British troops in the Red Fort used the tank as a swimming bath for many years."
