</h2>
<p align="justify">
    Jaipur, famous the world over as the " Pink City", is 260 km from Delhi and is a major destination in the popular Golden Triangle of Delhi-Agra-Jaipur.
    Jaipur is both a heritage city that dates back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century as well as a fast growing modern metropolis with all the trappings of a
    bustling capital city. The walled city with its pink facade and old heritage buildings attracts a lot of admiration from visitors and the stunning backdrop
    of ancient hill forts - Nahargarh, Amber, and Jaigarh are apt testimonials of the bygone era and a reminder of their lingering romance and chivalry.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Jaipur is named after its founder, the warrior and astronomer sovereign, Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II (ruled 1700 to 1743). The decision to move out of his
    hilltop capital Amber was also compelled by reasons of growing population and paucity of water. Moreover in the early 17th century the power of the great
    Mughals was dwindling under its aging Monarch Aurangzeb. After several centuries of invasions the North was now quiet and the wealth of the kingdom had
    increased considerably. Seizing upon this opportune time, Jai Singh planned his new capital in the plains. Jaipur is a corroborative evidence of Sawai Jai
    Singh's strong grounding in science and astrology and his Desh Diwan Vidyadhar Chakravarty with a strong instinct for planning.

</h4>
<h4 lang="en-US" align="justify">
    Located in the heart of the walled city, the City Palace Complex gives you an idea about the farsightedness of the founder of Jaipur Maharaja Sawai Jai
    Singh II. He left behind a legacy of some of the most imposing and magnificent architecture in the city. The palace is a blend of Mughal and Rajput
    architecture and the ex-royal family still lives in a part of the palace.
</h4>
<h4 lang="en-US" align="justify">
    On entering the complex lies the Mubarak Mahal, the palace of welcome or reception. Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh built the palace in the nineteenth century
    and now forms a part of the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum.On display here are a wide array of royal costumes, some very exquisite and precious
    Pashmina (Kashmiri) shawls, Benaras silk saris, Sanganeri prints and folk embroidery. An unusual display is that of voluminous clothes worn by Maharaja
    Sawai Madho Singh I (ruled 1751-68).
</h4>
<h4 lang="en-US" align="justify">
    The Maharani's Palace or the Palace of the Queen paradoxically puts on a display of Rajput weaponry. The inestimable collections of weapon date back to the
    15th century and are in a remarkable state of preservation. Between the armoury museum and the art gallery is the Diwan-E-Khas or Hall of Private Audience.
    This is a marble paved pavilion and on display here are the world's largest sterling silver objects - two gigantic silver vessels. These vessels were made
    for Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II, to carry water from the holy Ganga River for his journey to England. The Guinness Book of Records declared the silver
    vessels as the biggest silver objects in the world.

    Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh. This exquisitely designed garden with four sentry gates and a huge complex with small pools and fountains, lawns and beautiful

    son, the late Jagat Singh. This is not open to visitors but a mere view of this fort is impressive enough. The highlight of this area is the famous and
    auspicious temple of Lord Ganesh, which is situated at the hill. It is frequented by Jaipurites on religious occasions.

    <u>Jaigarh Fort</u>
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Jaigarh fort is also known as the fort of victory and is the most spectacular of the three-hilltop forts that overlook Jaipur. It was built between the
    15th and the 18th century AD, and stands 15 km from Jaipur, amidst rock-strewn, thorn-scrub covered hills, its forbidding stone ramparts being visible from
    the Jaipur town. In Mughal times, the Jaipur region was a major weapon-producing centre for the Rulers, several of the weapons are still on display in the
    fort's museum. The display includes a collection of canons, many of which are exquisitely decorated and were used in the Mughal campaigns led by the Rajput
    King, Raja Man Singh. There are passageways among the palaces and you can see a collection of coins and puppets. It is one of the few military structures
    of medieval India preserved almost intact, containing palaces, a granary, a well-planned cannon foundry, several temples, a tall tower and giant mounted
    cannon-the Jai Ban (Jaivan) which is the largest cannon on wheels in the world. Jaigarh does not have delicate structures or palaces like that of Amber but
    if you want a quick look at a hard-core fortress, this is it. A steep road goes up to the main gate, the Dungar Darwaza, from where the view is awe
    inspiring.

    <u>Amber Palace </u>
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Amber (pronounced Amer), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is situated about 11 kilometres from Jaipur. Amber is the classic and romantic fort-palace with a
    magnificent aura. It was the ancient citadel of the ruling Kachhwahas of Amber, before the capital was shifted to the plains, the present day Jaipur. The
    Amber Fort set in picturesque and rugged hills is a fascinating blend of Hindu and Mughal architecture. Constructed by Raja Man Singh I in the last decade
    of the 16<sup>th</sup> c and completed by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, the fort’s rugged forbidding exterior belies an inner paradise with a beautiful fusion of
    art and architecture. The interior wall of the palace depicts expressive painting scenes with carvings, precious stones and mirror settings. In the
    foreground is the Maota Lake that provides a breathtaking view. Built mainly for the warring enemies as a safe place, the heavily structured walls could
    defend the residents within the ramparts of the fort.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    All means of survival and luxuries for the royal families and the people who were concerned with the functioning of this small kingdom of the Kachhawahas
    were well provided. The Rajputs who had apparently won a small structure passed on by Meena tribes, later on renovated it into the grand Amber Fort. With a
    history going back so mant centuries, this place vibrates with its legendary past. Although many of the early structures have been literally ruined but
    those dating from 16th century onwards are remarkably well-preserved.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The fort has four sections; each within the premises, and one has to climb up the imposing stairway or else the broad aisle, where one can ride the
    elephant for a royal feel. The main gate Surajpol leads to Jaleb chowk, which is the main courtyard from where one can walk up the stairway that leads to
    the palace. Jaleb Chowk was also the area where returning armies were welcomed and they would display their war prize to the population at large.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Getting back from the temple the main stairways lead to the second courtyard of the fort. Here situated is the imposing Diwan-I-Aam, the hall of public
    audiences where the Maharaja received the populace and their petitions. This is a pavilion of double row of columns each capped by elephant head. There is
    a lattice gallery also.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Behind the exquisite and fabulous Ganesh Pol, "pol" meaning gate, residential apartments of the Maharaja are located. The Jai Mandir, the Hall of Victory
    is famous for its inlaid panel and dazzling mirror ceiling.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    On the other side is Sukh Niwas, the residence of pleasure. The palace has an ivory inlaid sandalwood door. A channel laid for flow of water is an
    inventive system of cooling. The water flowing from the channel wasn't wasted but allowed to flow into the garden. From there you can also enjoy viewing
    the fort rampart and its reflection in the Maota Lake.

    from Vrindavan have crafted the Rajput style wooden boats. A water treatment system was developed, local vegetation and fish reintroduced, the surrounding
    wetlands regenerated and five nesting islands created to attract migratory birds. There are decorated hallways and chambers on the first floor to climb all
    the way up to the fragrant Chameli Bagh. Across the lake, you can view the Aravalli hills, dotted with temples and ancient forts, and on the other side a

    style of architecture. The earliest temple was probably built in the 10th century AD. At the centre lies the idol of Parshwanath with seven serpent hoods.

</h2>
<p align="justify">
    Jodhpur was the former capital of Marwar state and was founded by Rao Jodha. It still retains some of its medieval character. The clan traces its origins
    back to the Hindu god, Rama, hero of the epic Ramayana, and thence to the sun. So the Rathors belong to the Suryavansha (solar race) branch of Kshatriyas,
    the warrior caste of Hindus. Centuries later, Jodha, the son of Ranmal, of the Rathore clan, (who also became the administrator of Mewar to assist Maharana
    Mokal) captured Mandore or Jodhpur in early 15<sup>th</sup> century, as it was formerly called and on the advise of an holy man, constructed the
    Meherangarh or the Majestic Fort.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    It is said that when the defeated Maharaja Jaswant Singh fled the battlefield of the victorious Mughal princes Aurganzeb and Murad in 1658, his proud wife
    refused to accept this insult to Rajput honour. Slamming the fort gate on his face, she sent him back to redeem the good name of the Jodhpur house. Legend,
    perhaps, but it captures the pride of the Rajput rulers of Jodhpur, a delightful, slow-paced city set on the edge of the Thar Desert.

<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    The best way to trace the stormy but glorious past of Jodhpur is to visit the aptly named Mehernagarh fort. Perched on a 150 m high hill, it is among the
    most formidable and magnificent forts in Rajasthan. Such was the threat of Rajput warring in 1459 that Rao Jodha and his successors built an almost
    impregnable fort on already superb natural defences. It was built on advice of a saint to establish an impregnable head-quarter. This fort is among the
    best in India with its exquisitely latticed windows, carved panels, elaborately adorned windows and walls of Moti Mahal, Phool Mahal, Sheesh Mahal.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Battle scars of canon ball hit by attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate. To the left is chhatri of Kirat Singh Soda, a soldier
    who fell while defending the fort against the armies of Amber. There are seven gates, which include Jayapol, built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his
    victories over Jaipur and Bikaner armies. Fatehpol was built by Maharaja Ajit Singh to mark the defeat of Mughals. The palm imprints still attract
    devotional attention and are covered by vermilion paste and paper-thin silver foil.

    The grandest of Mehrangarh's period rooms, the Phool Mahal was in all likelihood a private and exclusive chamber of pleasure. It was created by Maharaja
    Abhaya Singh (1724-1749) and has a ceiling rich in gold filigree. The gold came from Ahmedabad, Gujarat as war booty after his famous victory over the
    rebellious Mughal governor, Sarbuland Khan. The paintings, royal portraits and the ever-popular Raagmala, came much later, in the reign of Jaswant Singh

    Mandore was the former capital of Maharajas of Marwar and is located about 5 miles north of Jodhpur but was later abandoned for the security of Mehrangarh
    fort. Here you will find the dewals or cenotaphs of Jodhpur's former rulers.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Unlike the usual chhatri-shaped cenotaphs typical of Rajasthan, they were built along the lines of a Hindu temple, four storeys high, with fine columns and
    an elegant spire, all in red sandstone. The most impressive is the dewal of Maharaja Ajit Singh (reigned 1678-1724). These cenotaphs are set in beautiful
    landscaped gardens.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Nearby is the hall of heroes, dedicated to various deities and fabled Rajput folk heroes, whose statues are carved out of rock and painted in bright
    colors. Next door is a larger hall filled with brightly colored images of the various Hindu Gods. As you climb up the hill, you come to the ruined city of
    Mandore, with its old palace. The beautiful Maharanis cenotaphs set apart on a rocky outcrop are a ten-minute walk over the hill.

<p align="justify">
    The city has an interesting and a colourful past. The name ‘Ajmer’ is a modification of its earlier name ‘Ajayameru’, which means the invincible hill. This
    was the place for hill fort ‘Taragarh’, which was built by Ajay Pal Chauhan. This was a seat of power for the Chauhan dynasty till about 1194. Anasagar
    Lake, which was built by another Chauhan, Anaji, and the fort are the only remains of that bygone era.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The city of Ajmer is perhaps the perfect example of the unity that prevails in the diversity of the country. Founded by a Hindu, Raja Ajay Pal Chauhan, in
    the early 7th century, it houses the Dargah Sharif-tomb of Sufi Saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti. Today, the shrine, which is equally revered by Muslims and
    Hindus, attracts pilgrims from all over the world.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    After the fall of the Chauhan dynasty, Ajmer remained a part of the Delhi Sultanate. Subsequently, it became a bone of contention between the Sultans of
    Delhi, The Ranas of Mewar, the Rathors of Marwar and the Sultans of Gujrat. Peace was restored with the accession of Akbar to the Mughal throne who made
    Ajmer a full fledged province and the base of his operations in Rajputana. He also fortified the city, however only bits of the long wall remain. Later on,
    the celebrated English ambassador to the Mughal court, Sir Thomas Roe tried his best to conclude a commercial treaty between the Mughal Empire and England
    and met Jahangir at Akbar’s fort, Daulat Khana, who lived in Ajmer from 1613 to 1616. Finally, in 1818, the Marathas, who ruled Ajmer at the time, ceded it
    to Sir David Ochterlony and as a part of the British Empire, it remained under the care of successive superintendents.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The modern day Ajmer is not just a popular pilgrimage center but also a center of culture and education. Ajmer forms a convenient base for visiting other
    nearby towns, such as Pushkar (14 km), which houses one of the few Brahma temples in India.

</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The Dargah of Khwaja Muin-ud-din Chishti is one of the foremost landmarks of Ajmer. The Sufi saint, who was born in Persia in 1142, came to India after he
    received a prophetic vision in Mecca. He established the Chishtiya order, which is the foremost Sufi order in India. Through his message of love and his
    devotion to the poor, he was able to spread the word of Islam effectively and came to be known as Khwaja Garib Nawaz, the protector of the poor.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Chishti died in 1236 and his devotees now extend beyond Islam. The Dargah Sharif is considered a wish-fulfilling shrine. Akbar is known to have walked on
    two occasions from Agra to Ajmer in thanksgiving for boons granted.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The Dargah is approached through a massive gate with silver doors built in several stages. Mughal Emperors Akbar and Shah Jahan have built mosques in the
    complex. The saint's tomb is in the centre of the second courtyard and is surrounded by a silver railing and partly by a marble screen. The dome is gold
    plated. The mystic atmosphere inside the holy shrine is suffused with serenity, sanctity and spirituality.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    As you enter the Dargah courtyard, you see two massive 'degs' or cauldrons. Mughal Emperors Akbar and Jahangir originally donated these cauldrons, but they
    were replaced in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. The larger cauldron can hold over 4 thousand kilos of rice while the smaller one has a capacity to store over
    2 thousand kilos of rice.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    There is an unending stream of devotees to the shrine throughout the year, but its periphery show considerably more heightened all round activity when
    millions of devotees throng the shrine during the Urs fair. Urs is held on the seventh lunar month, according to Islamic calendar but varies according to
    the solar calendar.

    Legend has it that the Sisodias of Mewar are descended from the Sun God through Luv, the son of Lord Rama whose life story is told in India’s great epic,
    the Ramayana. The chronicles of the bards tell us that in the 6th century, Vallabhi was sacked by strangers from the west. Pushpavati, the queen of
    Vallabhi, who was on a pilgrimage offering prayers for her unborn child, heard of the destruction of Vallabhi and the death of her husband while travelling
    through the Aravalli hills in the north. Despairing, she took refuge in a cave, and there gave birth to a son whom she called Guhil or ‘cave born’. Then,
    entrusting her child to a maid servant, the queen ordered a funeral pyre to be lit, and walked into it to join her dead husband’s soul.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Guhil or Guhaditya, was befriended by the Bhils, the Adivasis, who had lived in the Aravalli hills since well before 2,000 BC. Among the Bhils, Guhaditya,
    grew in power and became a chieftain. His progeny came to be known as Guhilots.

    In the 7th century, the Guhilots moved north and down to the plains of Mewar, changing their name to Sisodia, after a village they encountered on the way.
    The descendants of Guhaditya were the great Ranas, Rawals and Maharanas of Mewar, the builders of forts and palaces. When the original capital of Mewar,
    Chittaurgarh was sacked for the third time by the armies of the Mughal emporer Akbar; Rana Udai Singh II withdrew into hills and ravines of the Aravallis.
    He saw a sage meditating by a lake and received his blessings and directions that this spot was an auspicious site for his new capital. The city was thus
    founded on the banks of Lake Pichola in mid-16<sup>th</sup> century.

<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    Mewar is known for its history of bloody battles which were fought by successive rulers to protect it against foreign invasions. However, this onslaught
    ended in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when the British intervened and a treaty was signed to protect Udaipur.

<p align="justify">
    By the time of India’s independence, the royal Mewar had ruled for 75 generations, a total of 1,400 years, the oldest of Rajasthan’s feudal dynasties.

    <u><strong>City Palace</strong></u>
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The City Palace, once the home of Mewar’s rulers, is today largely a museum run by the Maharana Mewar Foundation and houses a huge collection of protective
    gears and various kinds of weapons including the lethal two-pronged sword. The Palace actually consists of four major and several minor palaces forming a
    single breathtaking facade overlooking the Pichola Lake. Maharana Udai Singh initiated the construction of the palace and successive Maharanas added other
    structures to the complex but retained remarkable uniformity in the design. The approach to the palace is through the Hathi Pol (Elephant Gate) to the
    north on the main street of the city, leading to the Tripolia or triple gate of marble arches. It was customary to weigh the Maharana under this gate in
    gold and silver, which was distributed to the populace. Suraj Gokhada (or the balcony of the sun) is where the Maharana would grant public audiences mainly
    to boost the morale of the people in trying times. The Mor Chowk or the peacock square derives its name from a vivid blue decorative glass peacock on the
    wall.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The Rajya Angan, or the Royal Courtyard, is the place where Maharana Udai Singh is said to have met the sage. The rooms of the palace are superbly
    decorated with mirror tiles and paintings. Manak Mahal or the Ruby Palace has a lovely collection of glass and mirror work while Krishna Vilas displays a
    rich collection of miniature paintings. Moti Mahal (the pearl palace) has beautiful mirror work and the Chini Mahal has ornamental tiles all over.The Surya
    Chopar (the sun square) depicts a huge ornamental sun symbolising the sun dynasty to which the Maharanas and their ancestors belonged. The Bari Mahal is a
    central garden and some more beautiful paintings can be seen in the ‘Zenana Mahal’ (the ladies chamber).

<p align="justify">
    It is said that Maharana Karan Singh built this second island retreat for the family of his friend prince Khurram, who later become the Emperor Shah Jahan.
    The prince being the son of a Rajput mother received the royal favour. As a mark of his gratitude and a symbol of brotherhood, Prince Khurram exchanged
    turbans with Maharana Karan. This turban is preserved, still in its original folds, in the Government Museum at City Palace, Udaipur. The palace has some
    striking carvings including a row of elephants that look as if they are guarding the island. The exquisitely carved chhatri in grey and blue stone also
    attracts the visitors. Maharana Sarup Singh granted asylum to a number of European families during the revolt of 1857.

</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    Legend has it that, as a youth, Prince Jagat Singh once asked his father’s permission to take a group of friends with him to Jag Mandir for a bit of fun.
    The old Maharana refused, saying that for fun Jagat Singh should build his own palace on the lake. Stung, the prince did just that; he built a most
    magnificent palace on a rocky island nearby- a sort of retort to his father. Earlier, it was a royal summer palace which has now been converted into a five
    star palace hotel. The grounds cover an area of 1.6 hectares. The palace is an airy stucco complex floored with marble and has graceful granite columns.
    The gardens, fountains and lavishly decorated rooms are a refreshing retreat. The small island of Arsi Vilas near Jag Mandir was never built on. It is now
    a sanctuary for waterfowl and other birds.

    Kumbhalgarh Fort
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Kumbhalgarh Fort is a World Heritage Site located 84 kms north of Udaipur in the wilderness and is the second most important citadel after Chittaurgarh in
    the Mewar region. Cradled in the Aravali Ranges the fort was built in the 15th century AD by Rana Kumbha. The inaccessibility and hostility of the
    topography lend a semblance of invincibility to the fort. It served the rulers of Mewar as a refuge in times of strife. The fort also served as refuge to
    the baby king Udai Singh of Mewar. It is of immense sentimental significance for the people being the birthplace of Mewar's legendary king, Maharana
    Pratap.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The fort is self-contained in all respects to withstand a protracted siege. Its defences could be breached only once by the combined armies of the Mughal
    and of Amber primarily for scarcity of drinking water. There is a magnificent array of temples here of which the most picturesque place is the Badal Mahal
    or the palace of the clouds. The fort also offers a superb bird’s eye view of the surroundings. The fort's massive wall stretches some 36 kms with a wide
    enough to take eight horses abreast at some places. Maharana Fateh Singh renovated the fort in the 19th century. The fort's large compound has very
    interesting.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    A tour of Kumbalgarh fort can be linked with a visit to the adjoining wild life sanctuary, a habitat for a large variety of wildlife. The tourists can
    either trek on foot or opt for a jeep and horse safari, which is organised by local tour operators.

        Chittorgarh epitomizes Rajput spirit, valour, pride and romance. It reverberates with heroism and sacrifice the tales of which are still sung by the
        Bards of Rajasthan. According to the legend the construction of the fort was started by Bhim, a Pandav hero of mythological epic Mahabharata. Today,
        the imposing and awe inspiring fort stands on a 240-hectares site, on a 180m high hill and has a one kilometre zigzag ascent to it. Entry to the fort
        is through seven gates and one sees several memorials on the way are reminders of its glorious past. On the ascent between the second and the third
        gate, you see two ‘Chattris’ (cenotaphs) built to honour Jaimal and Kalla heroes of 1568 siege by Emperor Akbar.

        The fort fell thrice to the enemies in its entire history.The first attack occurred in 1303 when the Sultan of Delhi Ala-ud-din Khilji, overwhelmed by
        the beauty of Queen Padmini, besieged the fort with sinister designs to capture the queen. In 1535 Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat, besieged the
        fort causing immense carnage. It is said that 32000 men donned the saffron robes of martyrdom and rode out to face certain death. The women folk led by
        Rani Karnawati committed Jauhar (collective self immolation by fire) to save their honor.

<p align="justify">
    The historical site of Haldighati, situated towards the south-west of Nathdwara, witnessed the great legendary battle fought between Maharana Pratap and
    the Mughal army in 1576 AD. There is a beautiful memorial of Maharana Pratap and cenotaph with white marble columns, which is dedicated to the indomitable
    Maharana's loyal horse, Chetak.

        The temples at Ranakpur were built in the 15th century during the reign of Rana Kumbha. The town is considered as one of the five holy places for the
        Jain community, these were created in the 15th century. The central Chaumukha [four faced temple] is dedicated to Adinathji. The temple is an
        astounding creation of architectural splendor with 29 halls and 1,444 pillars, all distinctly carved, no two pillars being alike. Facing the main
        temple are the temples of Parasvanath-Neminath, with exquisite carvings which resemble the sculptures at Khajuraho. Another temple, which is a hot
        favourite with tourists is the Sun Temple dedicated to the Sun God. The temple has a polygonal wall, richly embellished with carvings of warriors,
        horses and celestial (Nakshatras, grahs) bodies.

        The faultless architecture, intricate carvings, delicate designs neatly chiselled idols, diverse and multiple hues and above all, the ambience of
        Ranakpur palace is at par with another equally famous group of Jain temples at Mt. Abu- the Dilwara temples.

    <u>Shreenathji Nathdwara</u>
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Forty eight km north of Udaipur, is the famous temple town of Nathdwara, one of the principal places of pilgrimage in Rajasthan. This Vaishnavite shrine
    was built in the 17th century and is dedicated to Lord Krishna. Legend has it that to prevent it from being desecrated and vandalized by the Mughal Emperor
    Aurangzeb, the devotees decided to shift Lord Krishna’s statue from Goverdhan near Vrindavan. When the statue reached the spot where the temple exists, the
    wheels with the axle of the bullock cart carrying the statue sank deep into mud. When all efforts failed to move the cart further the accompanying priest
    interpreted this as the Lord's indication and a temple was built here.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Devotees throng the shrine in large numbers during Janmashtmi, Lord Krishna's birthday. The priests treat the image like a living deity and tend to the
    lord with daily normal function like bathing, dressing and meals or Prasad.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The streets are narrow, cobbled and wind up the hill to the temple. Little shops sell all manner of goods; paintings, enamelled jewellery, and sweets that
    are sent to relatives abroad after they have been blessed by the deity. Here, you can also see <em>pichhwais</em> being painted.

            Kota
        </a>
    </u>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The city of Kota (formerly known as Kotah) is at the centre of the south-eastern region of Rajasthan widely known as Hadaoti or Hadavati, the land of the
    Hadas. The Hadas is a major branch of the Chauhan clan of Agnikul (fire dynasty) Rajputs. They had settled in the hilly terrain of Mewar near Bijolian at
    Bambaoda in the 12th century AD and soon extended their rule, conquering Bundi in 1241 and Kota in 1264. Originally, all this formed the Hada state of
    Bundi, with Kota as the jagir (land grant) of the eldest prince of Bundi. Kota later became a separate state in 1624.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Today, Kota is a unique confluence of the ancient and the modern. Though it houses technological wonders such as the hydroelectric power plant on the
    Chambal river or the well-known nuclear power plant, Kota still retains an old-world charm which draws hordes of tourists to the city. The riverside fort,
    opulent palaces, ancient temples and the scores of paintings and artefacts housed in them, clearly speak of rich, bygone era, where the city was a much
    coveted seat of power for many dynasties.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    History lovers can feast their eyes on the ceremonial objects which have been displayed in Akhade-ka-Mahal. The Badal Mahal has some exotic paintings of
    women, who loved dressing up and flaunting their beauty, People who are fond of examining the old schools of arts can test their knowledge with the
    paintings at the Zanana Mahal. Kota’s architectural masterpieces such as the Brij Raj Bhawan Palace, Jaguar mandir, the island palace, havelis and the
    royal cenotaphs are also worth seeing.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Besides these symbols of the past, Kota is also known for its cotton-silk Kota-doria saris, which are made in Kaithoon, a village close to Kota. Watching
    the artisans work on these saris is an experience in itself as they painstakingly weave the saris, which are then adorned with colours and fine gold
    thread. Miniature paintings are also famous here and most of them depict the many adventures of the past rulers of the city as they hunted on the banks of
    the river Chambal.

    </u>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The history of Bharatpur dates back to the epic age, when the Matsya Kingdom flourished here in the 5th century BC. The Matsyas were allies of the Pandavas
    in the Mahabharata war. According to tradition the name of Bharatpur is traced to Bharat, the brother of Lord Rama of Ayodhya whose other brother Laxman
    was given the highest place of family deity of the ruling family of Bharatpur. His name also appears in the state seals and coat-of-arms.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In 1733 AD, Suraj Mal had captured the fort of Bharatpur from Khemkaran, the rival chief, whom he killed and laid the foundation of Bharatpur City.
    Maharaja Suraj Mal displayed immense courage and carved a niche for himself in the midst of political disorder. Gathering around him fiercely martial Jat
    peasants, he went from one success to another. He accompanied Emperor Muhammed Shah against Ali Muhammed Ruhela and in 1748 AD, at the battle of Bagru, he
    led the Jaipur vanguard against the Marathas. He also defeated the commander-in-chief of the Mughal emperor. Despite being a very religious man he was
    secular.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Bharatpur is also called the Eastern gateway of Rajasthan. Maharaja Suraj Mal apart from being a brave General was also a great builder. He built numerous
    forts and palaces across the kingdom including the Pleasure Palace complex at Deeg. Bharatpur is today known the world over for its Keoladeo Ghana National
    Park.

    Chittorgarh (THIS NEEDS TO BE SHIFTED HERE )
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Chittorgarh epitomizes Rajput spirit, valour, pride and romance. It reverberates with heroism and sacrifice the tales of which are still sung by the Bards
    of Rajasthan. According to the legend the construction of the fort was started by Bhim, a Pandav hero of mythological epic Mahabharata. Today, the imposing
    and awe inspiring fort stands on a 240-hectares site, on a 180m high hill and has a one kilometre zigzag ascent to it. Entry to the fort is through seven
    gates and one sees several memorials on the way are reminders of its glorious past. On the ascent between the second and the third gate, you see two
    ‘Chattris’ (cenotaphs) built to honour Jaimal and Kalla heroes of 1568 siege by Emperor Akbar.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The fort fell thrice to the enemies in its entire history.The first attack occurred in 1303 when the Sultan of Delhi Ala-ud-din Khilji, overwhelmed by the
    beauty of Queen Padmini, besieged the fort with sinister designs to capture the queen. In 1535 Bahadur Shah, the Sultan of Gujarat, besieged the fort
    causing immense carnage. It is said that 32000 men donned the saffron robes of martyrdom and rode out to face certain death. The women folk led by Rani
    Karnawati committed Jauhar (collective self immolation by fire) to save their honor.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In 1568 Mughal Emperor Akbar conquered it and in 1616, Mughal Emperor Jehangir restored the fort to the Rajputs. Now, a new township sprawls below the hill
    on the west side.The fort has many magnificent monuments. Even though it is in ruins, it stands as an overwhelming reminder of its past history of triumph
    and tragedy and its walls resonate with the unbelievable legend of extraordinary men and women and their equally astounding deeds.

        </a>
    </u>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
    Bikaner stands on a slightly raised ground and is circumscribed by a seven km long embattled wall with five gates. The magnificent forts and palaces,
    created with delicacy in reddish-pink sandstone, bear testimony to its rich historical and architectural legacy. Surging lanes, colourful bazaars with
    bright and cheerful folks make Bikaner an interesting experience.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The history of this desert town dates back to 1486 when a Rathore prince, Rao Bikaji founded his kingdom. Bikaji was one the five sons of Rao Jodhaji the
    illustrious founder of Jodhpur. But Rao Bikaji was the most adventurous of them. Legend has it that an insensitive remark from his father about his
    whispering in the Durbar provoked Bikaji to set up his own kingdom towards the north of Jodhpur. The barren wilderness called Jangaldesh became his focus
    point and he transformed it into a livable city. He accomplished this task with 100 cavalry horses and 500 soldiers, and established his kingdom on 84
    villages abandoned by the 'Shankhlas'. When Bikaji died in 1504 his rule had extended to over 3000 villages.
    <br/>
    The strategic location of Bikaner on the ancient caravan routes that came from West/Central Asia made it a prime trade centre in those times.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Bikaner still retains the medieval grandeur that permeates the city's lifestyle. More readily called the camel country, the city is distinguished for the
    best riding camels in the world and hence boasts of having one of the largest Camel Research and Breeding farms in the world. Modern Bikaner is the result
    of the foresight of its most eminent ruler Maharaja Ganga Singh (1887-1943) whose reformative zeal set the pace for Bikaner transformation from a
    principality to a premier princely state.

    fortress of Bundi have a fairy tale quality about them. Few other palaces in India have such a picturesque location. Given the rulers lifestyle, it is

</h2>
<p align="justify">
    Legend has it that the city was named after a popular Bhil ruler Bansia, who was later defeated by Jagmal Singh, who became the first Maharaja of the area.
    However, many people believe that the place derives its name from the numerous bamboos or <em>baans</em> that grows here. Banswara is also known as little
    Kashi or Chhoti Kashi due to the presence of the twelve and half Swayambhu (self- manifested) Shivlings. Banswara is also known for its untouched tribal or
    Vagdi culture.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The district of Banswara is surrounded by Udaipur, Dungarpur, Chittaurgarh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Nestled in one of the many basins of the Aravallis
    and forming the eastern part of the region it is rich fauna and flora.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In 1913, under the leadership of social reformer Govindgiri, Bhil tribals (who form a majority ofthe inhabitants here) revolted against the British. A
    peaceful meeting at Mangarh hillock turned into a tragedy, when the British soldiers massacred thousands of Bhils in a Jallianwala Bagh-like event. Since
    then, Mangarh Dham, as it is now known is considered a sacred place. Kushalgarh, along with Banswara, were merged into Greater Rajasthan in 1949, which
    resulted in Banswara being regarded as a separate district.

    <strong>Churu</strong>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    The city of Churu was founded in 1620 by a Jat chieftain Churu. It was part of Jangaldesh prior to annexation by Rathores - Churu was ruled by Thakur
    Maldeo, the grandson of Rao Kandhal or Rawat Kandhal and uncle of Rao Bika, the Rathore Rajputs of Bikaner.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    In the 18th century Churu fell on the caravan route and ensured that the trading classes of the town were well off in their respective businesses. The
    Poddars were the most important traders of those times dealing mainly in woollens, especially Kashmir shawls. The Thakur (the local ruler) of Churu, Sheo
    Singh, imposed a heavy wool tax on the Poddars which compelled them to move to Sikar. The Rao of Sikar, Devi Singh, gladly welcomed them to a place 15km
    south of Churu where the Poddars established the town of Ramgarh.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    In 1818 the rule of the Thakurs ended and Churu came directly under the state of Bikaner. When the British came here in the 1830s, trade was absolutely
    nonexistent because of the shift to Ramgarh and also by the repeated raids by the rulers of Shekhawati. The Maharaja convinced the trading classes to
    return to Churu, thereby reviving the town and coming up with the most impressive painted havelis and temples in the whole of Rajasthan. In 1871 there was
    a battle between the forces of Churu and Bikaner when all the copper and brass had been exhausted, Churu Thakur asked his womenfolk to give a part of their
    silver ornaments and with this metal, shells for the cannons were made and used in the battle. The famous temple of Salasar Balaji is situated in the Churu
    district.

    ‘old world charm’ and transport you back several years. Dungarpur is one such example. The town has a varied terrain, from rugged hills in the northeast to
    fertile green fields in the south west. The land is fed by rivers Mahi and Som.
</p>

    The area is rich in teak, mahua, mango and Khajur trees. Nature lovers throng Dungarpur for its wildlife. Jackal, jungle cat, Indian fox, hyena,
    black-faced monkey, porcupine, common mongoose are quite commonly seen. Bird watchers can feast their eyes on partridges, peafowl, quails, cuckoos, eagles

    Named after Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner, Sri Ganganagar District was once a part of Bikaner State. This was a mostly uninhabited region. The history of
    this district is testimony to the vision and efforts of Maharaja Ganga Singh, who visualised and built the Gang Canal after the Indian famine of 1899–1900.
    The waters of Satluj River were brought into the region through the 89-mile long Gang Canal in 1927, turning this region into a breadbasket of Rajasthan.

    This Fort was constructed in 3<sup>rd</sup> century by a ruler of Jaisalmer in the memory of his father in an area of about 12 hectares and has over 6
    thousand kunguras or projections. It has many watch towers at the height of 90 feet. There were also 52 wells constructed here - 40 inside the fort and 12
    outside. There are several temples - Hanuman temple, Jain temple, a temple devoted to Radha, Raghunath temple and Bherun temple and one mosque.

<h4 lang="en-US">
    <u>Kalibangan</u>
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Kalibangan lies along the left bank of the dried-up bed of river Ghagggar it comprises three mounds. The excavations brought to light the grid layout of a
    Harappan metropolis, perhaps truly the first city of the Indian cultural heritage. The significant part of the evidence, however relates to the discovery
    of an early-Harappan settlement, immediately underlying the occupant remains of the Harappan citadel.The pre-Harappan settlement was fortified with a
    fortification wall of mud-bricks. The houses within the walled area were also made of mud-bricks. The distinctive trait of thes period was the pottery
    which was significantly different from that of the succeeding Harappans.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    An outstanding discovery was a ploughed field showing a cross grid of furrows to the south east of the settlement outside the town wall. This is perhaps
    the earliest ploughed field excavated so far. During the Harappan period, the structural pattern of the settlement was changed. There were now two distinct
    parts preceding occupations to gain an eminence over the lower city which was laid out on the natural plain towards the east.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The citadel complex was fortified consisting of two equal but separate sections. The southern half of the citadel contained some five to six massive
    platforms, some of which may have been used for religious or ritual purpose. The northern half of the citadel contained residential buildings of the elite.
    The lower city was also fortified. Within the walled city was the grid plan of streets running north-south and east-west dividing the area into blocks. The
    houses were built of mud-bricks, baked bricks being confined to drains, wells door-sills, etc. Beside the above two principal parts of the metropolis there
    was also a third one situated 80 metre east of the lower city It consisted of a modest structure containing four to five fire-altar and as such could have
    been used for ritualistic purposes Of the funds obtained from the excavation a cylindrical sea and an incised terracotta cake are quite significant.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The museum situated near the excavated site of Kalibangan houses three Galleries that display Pre-Harappan pottery; photographs of antique items that were
    excavated here and also some other antiques of great historical value.

    ruler of Bikaner, reconstructed this temple. The main idol of this temple is built with red stone that is 2.6 feet high and covered in ornaments. The
    temple is open every day. However, it gets crowded on the 8th and 9th day in the month of Chaitra due to the mela that is celebrated here during that time.

<p align="justify">
    About 850 years ago, a usurping Rajput prince sought the counsel of a hermit who lived in a cave on top of a rocky hill. The prince was Jaisal, of the
    Bhati clan; the hermit was Eesul, an oracle; the hill was Tricuta, a triple peaked rock, and the outcome of that meeting was the foundation of Jaisalmer,
    the Rock of Jaisal in 1156 AD.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Prince Jaisal had been appointed regent for his young nephew on the death of his brother at Lodurva, capital of the Bhati Rajputs. He had betrayed that
    trust and seized the power in his own right, but was uncertain of commanding the loyalty of his vassal princes. Fearing an uprising, he wished to move his
    capital to a less vulnerable site - Lodurva. Having heard of the prophetic powers of the hermit, he decided to consult him. The meeting proved fateful, for
    Eesul related a compelling myth about Tricuta, the place of his hermitage. Centuries ago, Lord Krishna himself had predicted that, in the time to come, a
    distant descendant of his Lunar clan would rule from Tricuta. This fired Jaisal’s imagination, for the Bhatis claim descent from the Chandravanshi or Lunar
    clan, and he decided to build his new capital on Tricuta. He was not discouraged by the oracle’s warning that the fort he built would be sacked at least
    twice, once by Allauddin Khilji and then a Pathan chieftain.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Today, the fort is the centre of the largest district in Rajasthan. For anyone who wishes to understand the spirit of historic Rajasthan, Jaisalmer is a
    rich source of sights and impressions.

    Jaisalmer Fort
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    The Jaisalmer fort, known as Sonar Quila or the Golden fort, rises from the sand and merges with the golden hues of the desert ambience. The setting sun in
    its most colourful shades gives it a fairy tale appearance. It is simply magical – as the bastions envelop a whole township that consists of the palace
    complex, the intricately carved havelis of rich merchants, several temples and the residential complexes of the armies and traders placed strategically on
    the trade route. It was from this trade route that the ancient caravans passed, distributing the riches for the prosperity to an otherwise non resourceful
    kingdom. These merchants served and acquired a great deal of power and noble status in the royal courts of Bhati Rajputs who founded the state in the 12th
    century AD and proceeded further. However, the rich merchants inspired by the classic style of the royals, constructed huge mansions (havelis) adjacent to
    each other in the nature of medieval culture and profusely decorated the walls and ceilings and intricately carved the outdoors and interiors.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The colourful art forms had some how relegated the royal heritage to a position of secondary importance. The craftsmen were usually Muslims who were
    induced on their journey to exhibit their skills in art forms. The result was an architectural purity that cannot be seen elsewhere.
</p>
<h4 lang="en-US">
    Government Museum
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Established by the Department of Archeology and Museum, it is frequented by tourists, who love delving into the history of this desert citadel. The trophy
    of the state bird Godawan - the great Indian bustard, is one of the highlights of the collection. Traditional house-hold items, rock-cut crockery and
    jewellery along with ancient statues from the 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> centuries are also interesting.

    Two architect brothers built this haveli in the 19th century. Interestingly, while one concentrated on the right, the other concentrated on the left and
    the result is a symphony epitomizing the side-by-side symmetry during construction. Paintings in miniature style monopolize the walls in the interior.
    Mighty tuskers carved out of yellow sandstone stand guard to the haveli. It is private property.
</p>
<h4 lang="en-US">
    Diwan Salim Singh Ki Haveli
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Built in the first half of the 18th century, the haveli has a beautiful exterior. Salim Singh was the prime minister of Jaisalmer in the 19th century AD.
    The mansion has a beautifully arched roof with superb carved brackets in the form of peacocks. It is said that once it had two additional wooden storeys in
    an attempt to make it as high as the Maharaja's palace, but the Maharaja had the upper storey demolished.

</h2>
<p align="justify">
    A tropical hill-resort in the middle of the Rajasthan desert would seem unbelievable. Yet this is exactly what Mount Abu is. The broken ridges of the
    Aravalli Hills attain their highest point (1,722 metres) at Guru Shikhar, the Saints’ Pinnacle, in the southwestern corner of Rajasthan, bordering the
    state of Gujarat. This range is separated from the main chain of Aravallis by a valley about 24 km wide. In this vale the fruits and vegetables that feed
    the surrounding region are grown.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    As you climb up the winding road to Mount Abu, the hill becomes covered by tropical forests with a wide variety of trees. Each curve of the road brings
    into view silk cotton and bottle brush, mango, bamboo, eucalyptus, wild pomegranate, coral, date palm and lime. There are also the colourful flame of the
    forest (the famous pallash of the ancient poems), gulmohur, jacaranda, amaltash and oleander.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Abu was selected as the site for one of the most sacred rites of the Vedic era, the yagna of the agnikund, or the sacrifice of the fire-pit out of which
    four clans of Rajput's Parmars, Chauhans, Pratiharas and Solankis were born.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Besides its beautiful Jain temples and the Brahmakumari Ashram, Abu was also known as a popular leisure and hunting spot for various royal families. The
    place presents an interesting contrast of British style bungalows and holiday lodges of the royals (Thikhana) with various tribal communities residing
    amidst the thick lush forest on the hills surrounding the region.

    Dilwara Temple
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Mount Abu is a centre of Jain pilgrimage and you will find one of the greatest achievements of the temple builder’s art here - the Dilwara temples, which
    were built between the 11th and 13th century. The carving in marble has an impressive degree of subtlety and complexity, delicacy and intricate details.
    The stone was manipulated with such skill and dexterity that the many variations on a theme could be encompassed on a single pillar or a frieze. Dilwara
    can overwhelm and satiate, but it cannot be missed. These temples enshrine various Jain tirthankaras (saints). Vimal Vasahi, the oldest temple, built by
    Vimal Shah, a minister of a Solanki ruler of Gujarat in 1031 AD, is dedicated to Adinath, the first of the Jain tirthankaras. Constructed of white marble,
    this is an outstanding example of Jain temple architecture. The central shrine has an image of Rishabhdev and a large courtyard with 52 small shrines, each
    housing a beautiful statue of a tirthankara with 48 elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The Luna Vasahi Temple, dedicated to the 22nd tirthankara, Neminath, was built in 1230 AD by two brothers - Vastupal and Tejpal, Minister of Raja
    Virdhavala, a ruler of Gujarat.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The door casings, friezes, architraves, pillars and the sculptures of porticos are simply astonishing. This structure which is unique would not have been
    possible without massive effort, inspired commitment and exceptional workmanship. Rewards in the form of silver and gold were offered to the workers. The
    most striking feature of this Jain temple is the marble pendant in the dome of the porch. It drops from the ceiling like an enchanting cluster of half-open
    lotuses with cups, so finely carved that they appear to be transparent.

    Ranthambhore National Park
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Situated at the junction of the Aravalli and the Vindhya ranges, Ranthambhore has been one of India’s conservation success stories. Since becoming one of
    the original areas under Project Tiger in 1973, the park has maintained much of its natural glory.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In 1973, the original sanctuary of 156 sq km was expanded to 411 sq km with a core area of 169 sq km and later become a national park. In 1984, an
    adjoining area of 104 sq km to the south became the Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary (named after the last ruling Maharaja of Jaipur).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    A 10<sup>th</sup> century fort, called Ranthambhore commanded a large area and until the late 13th century was the centre of a Hindu kingdom. During the
    18th century, the area was protected as a hunting area for and by the Maharajas of Jaipur. The fort is the natural focal point of the park with a series of
    well established artificial lakes stretching to the north. The rugged park terrain alternates between dry deciduous forest, open grassy meadow, dotted by
    several lakes and rivers that are only made passable by rough roads built and maintained by the Forest Department.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    A significant geological feature within the park is the ‘Great Boundary Fault’ where the Vindhaya plateau meets the Aravalli range. The rivers Chambal in
    the South and the Banas in the north bound the National Park. The few areas of lush vegetation are around the lakes and have pipul, mango, palas and banyan
    creating a thick forest. The huge banyan tree near Jogi Mahal at the base of the fort is reputedly the second-largest known and is worth a visit.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The major predator here is the tiger, but their territories overlap with those of the leopard, which are occasionally seen in the areas on the park
    periphery. A variety of birds including owls, langur (monkey), leopard, caracal, hyena, jackal, jungle cat, marsh crocodiles, wild boar, bears and various
    species of deer are also found in the park. The greater visibility of this magnificent animal, due to the careful management, has made the park well known
    as one of the easiest parks to spot and photograph tigers.

            <strong>Forts &amp; Monuments Ranthambhore</strong>
        </a>

</h2>
<p align="justify">
    The oldest settlement in the area near Sawai Madhopur was around the Ranthambhore fort. The exact origin of the Ranthambore fort is still disputed but it
    is generally accepted that there was a settlement at the site of the fort, as far back as the 8th century A.D. It is widely believed that the construction
    of the Ranthambore Fort was started during the reign of the Chauhan Rajput King Sapaldaksha in 944 AD. Another theory stipulates that King Jayant, also a
    Chauhan Rajput, built the Ranthambore Fort during 1110 AD. It is most likely that the construction of the fort commenced during the mid 10th Century A.D.
    and continued for a few centuries after that.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    Since the Ranthambore Fort controlled the trade routes between North India and Central India, it was highly coveted by the rulers of North India. The
    Ranthambore Fort had its golden moments during the reign of the king Rao Hammir, the last ruler of the Chauhan dynasty (1282 - 1301 AD). During 1300 AD,
    Ala-ud-din Khilji, the ruler of Delhi sent his army to capture the Fort. After three unsuccessful attempts, his army finally conquered the Ranthambore Fort
    in 1301 AD and ended the reign of the Chauhans. In the next three centuries the Ranthambore Fort changed hands a number of times, till Akbar, the great
    Mughal Emperor, finally took over the Fort and dissolved the State of Ranthambore in 1558. The fort stayed in the possession of the Mughal rulers till the
    mid 18th century.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    During the mid 18th century, Sawai Madho Singh I helped the Mughal Emperor for settling his problems in Delhi and received this fort as a gift. In 1763,
    Sawai Madho Singh fortified the nearby village of Sherpur and renamed it Sawai Madhopur. This town, which is now commonly known as the Sawai Madhopur City,
    lies in a narrow valley between two parallel hills, at the South Western edge of the Ranthambore National Park. In early 20<sup>th</sup> century a railway
    link was constructed between Jaipur and Sawai Madhopur.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    The Ranthambore National Park is named after the 10th century Ranthambore fort, which covers the entire top of a hill at the heart of the Park. The walls
    of the fort are about 7 kilometers in length and include an area of nearly 4 square kilometers. All around the fort, one can see many old ruins, including
    palaces, temples, cenotaphs, step-wells and houses. It is surrounded by massive stonewalls which are strengthened by towers and bastions. The stone for the
    masonry was mined from inside the Fort and the mines were later turned into ponds for water storage. The main approach to the Fort lies through a narrow
    valley, which had four fortified gateways. Of these, only the first gate - Misradara gate, is still standing. There are many ruined buildings inside the
    Fort, with Hammir's Court, Badal Mahal, Dhula Mahal and Phansi Ghar being the most prominent of them. The Ganesh Temple, which lies very close to the main
    entry gate to the Fort, attracts a steady flow of pilgrims, mainly from the rural hinterland. During the annual Ganesh festival, tens of thousands of
    pilgrims visit the temple, from all over the country.
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify">
    A small perennial stream called Gupt Ganga flows in one part of the Fort. Here one can also see a large number of birds, Langurs, the odd small cat and
    sometimes, even leopards. The fort is one of the best places to look for the very rare and elusive Fishing cat. A good day to visit the fort is Wednesday,
    the day of the Lord Ganesh, when a lot of local people visit the Ganesh temple dressed in their best finery.

            Shekhawati
        </a>
    </u>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
    Shekhawati lies in a triangle between Jaipur, Bikaner and Delhi and the entire region is considered an open air museum for its beautiful frescoes. Since
    the 15th century when Rao Shekha opposed the rule of the Amber kings, the region remained a semi-autonomous collection of thikanas (feudal states). In the
    middle of the 19th century, the inhabitants of Shekhawati began to patronise the art of fresco painting. These paintings depict local legends, animals,
    portraits, hunting and wrestling scenes. The roads of Shekhawati, now like any other, were once caravan routes where the productions of India, Kashmir, and
    China, were interchanged for those of Europe, Africa, Persia and Arabia. Even though the trade rivalry with the British had pushed the Marwaris from
    Shekhawati to the ports, they never ceased to think of Shekhawati as their own land and this explains the enormous structures raised in nostalgia.The
    merchants built for the community: wells and reservoirs, dharamshalas (pilgrim resthouses), schools, gaushalas (shelter for cows), and temples. In the
    memory of their ancestors, they constructed cenotaphs, and for their families large havelis (mansions).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The Rajputs seems to have been the first to have ordered a frescoed room in a fort or on a chatri (cenotaph) commemorating a hero. The Marwaris, the
    merchant community which prospered on the trade routes between Delhi and the coast and between central Asia and China, later became even more extravagant
    patrons.

    Khatu Shyam ji

    The legend of this immensely popular Krishna temple can be traced back to the epic, Mahabharat where Barbareek, the son of great Pandav brother, Bhim and
    Nag Kanya (snake princess) displayed his great martial skills. This pleased Lord Shiva who gave his blessings in the form of three infallible arrows (‘Teen
    Ban’) and Agni Dev (fire god) gave him a bow to enable him to conquer all the three worlds.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    During the famous battle, Lord Krishna asked young Barbareek to sacrifice his head, otherwise the victory of the Pandavas would not be possible since he
    possessed the ‘Teen Ban’. The boy kept his promise of ‘Sheesh Dan’ as a true Kshatriya but at the same time wished to watch the war and his wish was
    granted. After the battle, his head was buried in Khatu where the king had a dream and was inspired to construct a temple and worship the head. Till date
    his devotees are blessed by just pronouncing his name from the bottom of their heart with true ‘Samarpan’ (surrender). The devotees from all around the

    Kishangarh
</h4>
<p align="justify">
    Kishangarh is charming town that lies 27 km before Ajmer on the Jaipur Road. It was founded by Kishan Singh in 1611, who was the brother of the Raja of
    Jodhpur. In the 18th century, it was recognised as one of the finest schools of miniature paintings. Though a smaller school with a much shorter duration
    it had a more refined style. It peaked under the patronage of Savant Singh, an heir to the throne who later became a hermit. He was himself a painter and
    poet and wrote verses under the pseudonym of Nagaridas.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    It is said that Savant Singh modelled as Krishna while his mistress Bani Thani modelled for Radha. In 1757, Satwant Singh, abdicated and left with Bani
    Thani for Vrindhavan. The artists concentrated on the Krishna Leela theme, but they portrayed Krishna in a courtly instead of a pastoral setting. The
    paintings belonged to the rajas of Kishangarh and were first seen by the outside world in the 1940s.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The old city of Kishangarh still has the flavour of the magic world created by the artists. Modern Kishangarh is bustling and crowded, important as a
    wholesale market for red chillies and a cotton weaving centre. But Kishan Singh’s city is about 4 km away. A road leads to the fort and palaces, which
    overlook the lake in the centre of which is another palace accessible by boat. A walk through the cobbled streets can be rewarding. The atmosphere is
    decidedly medivial and in many havelis painters of miniatures are still at work. There is an interesting little bazaar, where goldsmiths and silver smiths
    can be seen crafting traditional jewellery.
</p>
<h4 lang="en-US">

    Centre, addresses problems of drinking water, girl education, health &amp; sanitation, rural unemployment, income generation, electricity and power, as
    well as social awareness and the conservation of ecological systems in rural communities.
